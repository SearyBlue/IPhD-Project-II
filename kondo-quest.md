- At fixed point, $\frac{dK}{d\Lambda}$ should be zero. But $K=4$ makes it infinite.
- The equation $d_\Lambda K = \frac{n K^2}{1-\frac{K^2}{16}}$ is valid only close to $\Lambda=0$. How can we integrate that for the whole range?
- The integral gives $n(0)$ instead of $-n(0)$
- Why doesn't the URG goes on to decouple the Kondo cloud and the impurity spin as well?
- How do we get the singlet ground state?
- Why drop terms of same spin in eq. 33?
- The derivative should produce a factor of 2 in eq. 34.
- In eq. 54, the $s^+$ and $s^-$ should probably be interchanged.
- How would you plot eq. 60?
