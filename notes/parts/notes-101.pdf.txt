• Since we truncated at third order, we need 𝐷 − |𝜖𝑑 |  𝑣± . This gives us 𝐷  |𝜖𝑑 |.

Numerical Renormalization Group Calculation of the
symmetric SIAM

NRG calculations of the symmetric SIAM were carried out by H. R. Krishnamurthy, Wilkins
and Wilson in ref. [1]. They identified three fixed points in the phase diagram. Two of
them, the free-orbital and the local moment, are unstable while the strong-coupling fixed
point is stable. These fixed points along with typical RG flows are marked in fig. 2.5. The

Figure 2.5: Schematic diagram of RG flows and fixed points of the symmetric SIAM, as
obtained by ref.[1]. The y-axis is the impurity site repulsion 𝑈 = − 12 𝜖𝑑 while the x-axis
is the hybridisation parameter Δ ∼ 𝜌𝑉 2 . The abbreviations mark the three fixed-points:
FO is free-orbital, LM is local moment and SC is strong-coupling. The fixed-points are
described in the text.
free-orbital fixed point is described by 𝑈 = 𝑉 = 0. The local moment fixed point is described by 𝑈 → ∞, 𝑉 = 0. The strong-coupling fixed point is described by 𝑈 = finite, 𝑉 → ∞.
The temperature-dependent susceptibility is found to be very similar to that obtained
from the Kondo model, with a suitably-defined 𝑇𝐾 . It starts from a constant value at
low-temperatures to a Curie-Weiss like form at high temperatures, with the Curie-Weiss
constant at very large temperatures being equal to 81 .

3.1.1

Description of the problem

We are given a Hamiltonian H
 which
 is not completely diagonal in the occupation number basis of the electrons, 𝑛ˆ 𝑘 : H , 𝑛𝑘 ≠ 0. 𝑘 labels any set of quantum numbers depending
on the system. For spin-less Fermions it can be the momentum of the particle, while for
spin-full Fermions it can be the set of momentum and spin. There are terms that scatter
electrons from one quantum number 𝑘 to another quantum number 𝑘0.
We take a general Hamiltonian,

H = 𝐻𝑒 𝑛ˆ 𝑞𝛽 + 𝐻ℎ 1 − 𝑛ˆ 𝑞𝛽 + 𝑐𝑞𝛽

want to decouple (𝑞𝛽).

Chapter 3. Unitary Renormalization Group Method
It is clear that 𝑈 is the diagonalizing matrix for H . Hence we can frame this problem as an
eigenvalue equation as well. Let |𝜓1 i , |𝜓0 i be the basis in which the original Hamiltonian
H has no off-diagonal terms corresponding to 𝑞𝛽. Hence, we can write

H |𝜓𝑖 i = 𝐻˜ 𝑖 |𝜓𝑖 i , 𝑖 ∈ 0, 1
(3.1.5)
Since |𝜓𝑖 i is the set of eigenstates of H and |𝑖i is the set of eigenstates in which 𝑈H𝑈 †
has no off-diagonal terms corresponding to 𝑞𝛽, we can relate |𝜓𝑖 i and |𝑖i by the same
transformation : |𝜓𝑖 i = 𝑈 † |𝑖i. We can expand the state |𝜓𝑖 i in the subspace of 𝑞𝛽:
Õ
|𝜓𝑖 i =
| 𝑗i h 𝑗| |𝜓𝑖 i ≡ | 1i |𝜙1𝑖 i + | 0i |𝜙0𝑖 i
(3.1.6)
𝑗=0,1

where |𝜙𝑖𝑗 i = h 𝑗| |𝜓𝑖 i. If we substitute the expansion 3.1.2 into the eigenvalue equation
3.1.5, we get

can be separated into a purely

the subspace of 𝑞𝛽, so it is diagonal in 𝑞𝛽 and we can expand it as 𝜔𝑖 = 𝜔𝑖 𝑛𝑞𝛽 + 𝜔𝑖 1 − 𝑛𝑞𝛽 .
Using the expansion 3.1.6, we can write
𝜔ˆ 𝑖 |𝜓𝑖 i = 𝜔ˆ 𝑖1 | 1i |𝜙1𝑖 i + 𝜔ˆ 𝑖0 | 0i |𝜙0𝑖 i

(3.1.10)

Since the only requirement on |𝜓𝑖 i is that it diagonalize the Hamiltonian in the subspace
of 𝑞𝛽, there is freedom in the choice of this state. We can exploit this freedom and choose
the |𝜙0𝑖 , i to be an eigenstates of 𝜔ˆ 𝑖1,0 corresponding to real eigenvalues 𝜔𝑖1,0 :

Form of the unitary operators

Although we have found the correct similarity transformations 𝑈𝑖 (eqs. 3.1.19), we need
to convert them into a unitary transformation. Say we are trying to rotate the eigenstate
|𝜓1 i into the state | 1i. We can then work with the transformation
(3.1.23)

𝑈1 = 1 + 𝜂

In this form, this transformation is not unitary. It can however be written in an exponential form:
𝑈1 = 𝑒 𝜂
(3.1.24)
using the fact that 𝜂2 = 0. It is shown in ref. [25] that corresponding to a similarity transformation 𝑒𝜔 ,there exists a unitary transformation 𝑒𝐺 where

Fixed point condition

Within the URG, it is a prescription that the fixed point is reached when the denominator
of the RG equation vanishes. This is equivalent to either 𝜔𝑖1 = H1𝑑 or 𝜔𝑖0 = H0𝑑 . This shows
that at the fixed point, one of the eigenvalues of 𝜔ˆ 𝑖 matches the corresponding eigenvalue
of the diagonal blocks. This also leads to the vanishing of the off-diagonal block, because

Multiple off-diagonal terms

There is a subtle assumption in the definitions eq. 3.1.14. In order for 𝜂 to be the Hermitian conjugate of 𝜂† , H𝑑 cannot have any information that relates to the structure of 𝑇 .

Equivalence of the two unitaries and preservation of partial
trace

In the subsection 3.1.4, we determined the form of the operator 𝑈1 that unitarily decouples the node 𝑞𝛽 from the other degrees of freedom. Eq. 3.1.29 was derived by reading off
the transformation of | 1i to |𝜓1 i, the first equation in 3.1.18. We could easily have chosen
the other equation in the same equation set,


|𝜓0 i = 1 + 𝜂† | 0i |𝜙0𝑖 i
which gives a similarity transformation 1 + 𝜂† and hence a unitary

This 𝜂 will however be different from the 𝜂 in eq. 3.1.29. The reason is, in order to get
𝑈1 , we must start from the eigenvalue equation H |𝜓1 i = 𝐻˜ 1 |𝜓1 i. This means that the
corresponding 𝜔ˆ will be defined as 𝜔ˆ 1 = 𝐻˜ 1 − H 𝑖 . On the other hand, in order to get 𝑈0 we
must start with H |𝜓0 i = 𝐻˜ 0 |𝜓0 i, and hence this 𝜔ˆ will be 𝜔ˆ 0 = 𝐻˜ 0 − H 𝑖 . This difference in
the 𝜔ˆ will define two different sets of 𝜂:

This is the constraint that ensures that both unitaries give the same effective Hamiltonian. The condition 𝜂1 + 𝜂0 = 0, when expressed without resolving 𝜔ˆ into its eigenvalues
can also be shown to be a statement of the preservation of the partial trace under the RG
flow.

A note on the various quantum fluctuation scales 𝜔 𝑖

At a particular step of the URG, there are two quantum fluctuation energy scales associated with each sector. If we rotate |𝜓1 i to | 1i (particle/occupied sector), the corresponding unitary will be a function of 𝜔10,1 . If we, on the other hand, rotate |𝜓0 i to | 0i
100

Chapter 3. Unitary Renormalization Group Method
(hole/unoccupied sector), the unitary will be a function of 𝜔00,1 . The superscript 𝑗 sig𝑗
nifies whether this particular 𝜔𝑖 is an eigenvalue corresponding to | 1, 𝜙𝑖 i or | 0, 𝜙𝑖 i. 𝜔𝑖0
occurs in the many-body transition operator 𝜂, because 𝜂 is preceded by 𝑐 and hence it
picks out the eigenstate | 0, 𝜙𝑖 i. On the other hand, 𝜔𝑖1 occurs in the many-body transition
operator 𝜂† , because that is preceded by 𝑐† . This constrains these two values, because we

†
must have 𝜂(𝜔𝑖0 ) = 𝜂† (𝜔𝑖1 ) (eq. 3.1.16), for each value of 𝑖, giving us two constraints in

total. The subscript 𝑖 signifies whether 𝜔𝑖 is a part of the particle sector unitary 𝑈1 (𝜔1 )
𝑗
or the hole sector unitary 𝑈0 (𝜔0 ). As mentioned in the previous section, since both ways
𝑗
𝑗
are equivalent, we must have 𝑈1 = 𝑈0 which leads to the constraints 𝜂(𝜔0 ) = −𝜂(𝜔1 ). All
the independent constraints are listed below.
𝜔10 − 𝜔11 = H𝑑0 − H𝑑1
𝜔00 − 𝜔01 = H𝑑0 − H𝑑1

(3.1.62)

𝜔10 + 𝜔00 = 2H𝑑0

The first two come from 𝜂(𝜔𝑖0 ) = 𝜂† (𝜔𝑖1 ) while the last comes from 𝜂(𝜔0 ) = −𝜂(𝜔1 ).

These are the only independent relations. Other relations like the one between 𝜔10 and
𝜔01 can be derived from these. This means that we have four 𝜔 and three constraints,
such that each step of the URG is characterized by just a single independent quantum
fluctuation scale.

3.2

Prescription

Given a Hamiltonian

H = H1 + H0 + 𝑐†𝑇 + 𝑇 † 𝑐

(3.2.1)

the goal is to look at the renormalization of the various couplings in the Hamiltonian
as we decouple high energy electron states. Typically we have a shell of electrons at
some energy 𝐷. During the process, we make one simplification. We assume that there
is only one electron on that shell at a time, say with quantum numbers 𝑞, 𝜎, and calculate the renormalization of the various couplings due to this electron. We then sum the
momentum 𝑞 over the shell and the spin 𝛽, and this gives the total renormalization due
to decoupling the entire shell.
From eq. 3.1.45, the first two terms in the rotated Hamiltonian are just the diagonal parts
of the bare Hamiltonian; they are unchanged in that part. The renormalization comes
from the third term. For one electron 𝑞𝛽 on the shell, the renormalization is

scaling”-type of renormalization that was used to get the scaling equations in the Kondo

These equations will now need to be simplified. For example, in the particle sector, we
can set 𝑛ˆ 𝑞𝛽 = 0 in the numerator, because there is no such excitation in the initial state.
Similarly, in the hole sector, we can set 𝑛ˆ 𝑞𝛽 = 1 because that state was occupied in the
initial state. Another simplification we typically employ is that H0𝑑,1 will, in general, have
the energies of all the electrons. But we consider only the energy of the on-shell electrons in the denominator. After integrating out these electrons, we can rearrange the
remaining operators to determine which term in the Hamiltonian it renormalizes and
what is the renormalization.
At first sight, one might think that we must evaluate lots of traces to obtain the terms in
ΔH . A little thought reveals that

Star Graph URG

The first URG solution of the star graph problem is in ref. [27]. The system consists of
𝑁 spin-like degrees of freedom (labeled 1
through N) individually talking to a spin

at the
center (labeled 0). Each spin 𝑖 (∈ 0, 𝑁 ) has
an on-site energy 𝜖𝑖 . The
 coupling strength between 0 and 𝑖 (∈ 1, 𝑁 ) is 𝐽𝑖 . We choose
 the on
site energies such that 𝜖𝑖+1 > 𝜖𝑖 , 𝑖 ∈ 𝑁 − 1, 1 .
In this way, 𝜖1 is the infrared limit and 𝜖𝑁 is
the ultraviolet limit.

The RG involves decoupling the nodes 𝑁 through 1, and looking at the resultant renormalization in 𝜖𝑖 and 𝐽𝑖 . As a simplification, we will ignore the lower nodes in the denominator and keep only the node currently being decoupled, ie node 𝑁. Since node 0
is connected to node 𝑁, we will keep node 0 in the denominator as well. Making this
simplification gives

Nature of flows

We are interested in looking at the renormalization of the central node energy 𝜖0 , upon
removing the nodes 𝑁 through 1. We will hence concentrate on the second RG equation.
We first make some simplifying assumptions: 𝐽𝑖 = 𝐽, 𝜖𝑖 = 𝜖 for all 𝑖 ∈ {1, 𝑁 }.

(3.3.18)

Our goal here is to look for a fixed-point condition such that the denominator vanishes at
some point of the RG. If we start with a bare of 𝜖0 such that 𝜔˜ − 12 𝜖0 > 0, the denominator
will be positive and the RG equation will be irrelevant. This means that 𝜖0 will keep on
decreasing, and the denominator will keep on becoming more and more positive, meaning there cannot be a fixed point in this situation.
If, on other hand, we start with a bare of 𝜖0 such that 𝜔˜ − 12 𝜖0 < 0, the denominator
will be negative and the RG equation will be relevant. This means that 𝜖0 will keep on
increasing, and the denominator will keep on becoming more and more negative, meaning there cannot be a fixed point in this situation either. These situations are depicted in
figure 3.3.
Since we cannot find a fixed point, we will use the other 𝜔 in the URG formalism. Recall that 𝜂 and 𝜂† will, in general, have different 𝜔, eq. 3.1.14.

We now repeat the exercise of determining the relevance of the flows under various
regime. If we start with a bare 𝜖0 such that 𝜔˜ + 21 𝜖0 > 0, then the denominator is positive

Figure 3.3: RG flow for the two cases. The green line is the distance between the bare
values of the two couplings, and hence also the magnitude of the denominator. The red
arrow denotes the direction in which 𝜖0 will flow. Upward flow is increase. In both cases,
the flow is such that the distance between the two quantities (and hence the magnitude
of the denominator) increases. The RG fixed point occurs when the magnitude of the
denominator goes to 0. This happens if the distance vanishes. Since the distance necessarily increases, we cannot get a fixed point in this way.

Figure 3.4: RG flow for the two cases with the new −𝜔˜ = 𝜔0 − 12 𝜖 + 14 𝐽. Now we can see that
in both cases, the flow is such that the distance (green dotted line) between the couplings
decreases. A fixed point is reached when this distance vanishes.

Chapter 3. Unitary Renormalization Group Method
so the renormalization will be irrelevant. 𝜖0 will decrease until we reach 𝜔˜ + 12 𝜖0 = 0. This
will be a fixed point. However, if we start with a bare 𝜖0 such that 𝜔˜ + 12 𝜖0 < 0, then the
denominator is negative so the renormalization will be relevant. 𝜖0 will increase until
we reach 𝜔˜ + 21 𝜖0 = 0. This will again be a fixed point. This new situation is depicted in
figure 3.3.

If 𝜔˜ and 𝜖0 are of the same sign at the bare level, then it is easy to see that since the fixed

Fixed points

The fixed points are obtained numerically by solving the RG equation. As mentioned
before, there are two types of solutions: The first kind is those in which 𝜖0 and 𝜔˜ are of
the same sign, and the former flows to the latter without crossing the 0 axis. These flows
are shown (obtained numerically) in fig. 3.5. The second kind are those where the two
couplings have different signs, and so 𝜖0 flows to 0. These are shown in fig. 3.6.

The goal is to disentangle an electron 𝑞𝛽 from the Hamiltonian, 𝑞 being the momentum
and 𝛽 the spin. The diagonal part of the Hamiltonian is


H𝑑 = 𝜖𝑞 𝑛ˆ 𝑞𝛽 + 𝐽𝑧 𝑆𝑑𝑧 𝛽 𝑛ˆ 𝑞𝛽 − 𝑛ˆ 𝑞𝛽
(3.4.2)
Note that we keep only those terms in the diagonal part that relate to either the impurity or the electron we are disentangling-𝑞𝛽. This piece H𝑑 is the one that comes in the
denominator. Note that in this form, the hole energy comes out to be zero, because the
Hamiltonian is written only in terms of 𝑛ˆ 𝑞𝛽 . To remedy this, we write the Hamiltonian
in terms of 𝜏𝑞𝛽 = 𝑛ˆ 𝑞𝛽 − 21 .
H𝑑 = 𝜖𝑞 𝜏𝑞𝛽 + 𝐽𝑧 𝑆𝑑𝑧 𝛽 𝑛ˆ 𝑞𝛽

𝐸3 = 𝜖𝑞 − 𝐽𝑧

(3.4.8)

For the first two term, note that these terms do not flip the spin; hence, the denominator
should reflect that. The total magnetization for the spin 𝛽 in the initial state is 𝑛ˆ 𝛽 = 𝑛ˆ 𝑞𝛽 = 1,

because of the 𝑞𝛽. It is also 1 in the intermediate state, because of the spin 𝑘𝛽: 𝑛ˆ 𝛽 = 𝑛ˆ 𝑘𝛽 = 1.
This holds for both 𝐸1 and 𝐸2 . The impurity magnetization is however 1 in the first term
but −1 in the second term. Hence,

Numerical Solutions
𝜖

The symmetric scaling equation 3.4.28 was solved numerically with the choice 𝜔 = − 2𝑞 ,
for both positive and negative bare values of 𝐽. For sufficiently low values of 𝜔, the
Kondo coupling 𝐽 flows to the strong-coupling limit. This limit, as obtained from the
URG, is of course finite. This can be reconciled with the NRG result 𝐽 ∗ = ∞ by noting the
fact that increasing the bare bandwidth 𝐷 does increase the value of URG 𝐽 ∗ , such that in
the thermodynamic limit 𝐷 → ∞, URG should give 𝐽 ∗ → ∞. This is shown in fig. 3.8

Figure 3.7: Flow of 𝐽 towards the strong-coupling fixed point (right) and the weak coupling saddle-point (left). The x-axis indicates the index of the energy shell being decoupled. The largest value (UV) is the first step, and we go towards the left (IR).
