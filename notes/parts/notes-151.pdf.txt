where H 0 = H 𝑑 + H 𝑖 . The URG generator can be recast (starting from the definitions of

The last equality comes about because both 𝐺 and H 𝑑 are completely diagonal and hence

The most obvious difference with the CUT version is the presence of the off-diagonal
piece −H𝑋 . This is a result of the philosophical difference between URG and CUT-RG while CUT-RG gradually suppresses the off-diagonal matrix elements, URG makes the
off-diagonal components in each 2 × 2 block vanish completely. We can instead look at
the renormalization in the diagonal part of the Hamiltonian under URG:

Leaving aside the obvious differences in the philosophies (the presence of 𝜔 in URG or
the fact that while URG decouples as a flow in the bandwidth, CUT uses a general parameter 𝜆 or the algorithmic difference that while URG decouples one specific node, CUT
tries to make the Hamiltonian band-diagonal), the major physical difference is the presence of the total Green’s function in the URG equation. It must be noted that while CUT
employs the entire off-diagonal part in H𝑋 , the H 𝐼 of URG contains only those parts that
are off-diagonal with respect to the node being decoupled at this step.
To bring the URG form closer to CUT, we can make some approximations.

Note that in going from eq. 4.3.30 to the simplified form eq. 4.3.33, we had to drop all
quantum fluctuations in the denominator and we lose the fixed point structure in the
process. This results in the distinction that while URG can reach a fixed point theory in
a finite number of steps, CUT cannot do so.

4.4

Comparison of the Canonical Transformations

We have considered three canonical transformations in this section: the Poor Man’s scaling (PMS), the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation (SWT) and the continuous unitary transformation renormalization group (CUT-RG). PMS and SWT are more or less identical;
they differ in the context in which they are used. PMS is used when there is an entire
spectrum of energies in the model, ranging from a low energy limit to a high energy; it
is then employed to decouple the highest energy modes in an iterative fashion. SWT is
used when the Hamiltonian can be split into one high and one low energy part, and we
need to decouple these two modes. It is clear when seen from this perspective that SWT
is like a one-shot PMS; it decouples the UV from the IR in one step, compared to the iterative approach of PMS. However, as has been shown in the previous subsections, both
140

Chapter 4. Connection between URG and Other Canonical Transformations
PMS and SWT can be formalized in an identical fashion, so that one can be switched for
the other in both contexts.
Now that we have established that PMS and SWT are formally identical, we can relate
them to URG. URG is similar in philosophy to PMS in the fact that URG also successively
decouples high energy modes from the low energy ones. The difference is that URG takes
care of the quantum fluctuations, at least in principle, by introducing a new set of energy scales 𝜔. These 𝜔 then parameterise the RG flows of URG, compared to the single RG
flow of PMS. Since SWT is formally the same as PMS, these is also a comparison between
SWT and URG. Both PMS and SWT trivialize the quantum fluctuation scales of URG by
replacing it with the bare energy values.
CUT-RG is philosophically different from the other transformations. Its goal is to gradually reduce the contributions of the off-diagonal terms by making them decay along
a certain scale 𝑙. Off-diagonal terms that connect states with large energy differences
decay faster. In this sense, there is no sequential dropping out of off-diagonal terms; all
off-diagonal terms disappear at 𝑙 = ∞. In this sense, it is like a continuous version of SWT.
While SWT strives to remove an entire off-diagonal term in one-shot, CUT RG does this
gradually by introducing a scale 𝑙. This separation of scales is absent in SWT. It does exist
in URG and PMS, albeit in a different fashion. There, the separation comes in when we
decouple single electron states starting from the Brillouin zone boundary Λ𝑁 and come
down to the Fermi surface Λ0 . Each Λ provides a natural energy scale for separating the
high and low energy physics.
If one integrates the continuum generator 𝜂 over all the scales, one should recover something analogous to the SWT generator. This generator is however necessarily perturbative in the off-diagonal term, since by definition 𝜂 will only be of first order in H𝑋 . This
is in contrast to the non-perturbative generators in URG and, at least in principle, PMS.
This non-perturbative form is encapsulated in the presence of a second completely different set of energy scales 𝜔 (or 𝐸 in PMS). This second energy scale is absent in CUT RG
because it takes care of at most the second order term.
Another point to note is that since SWT keeps the entire off-diagonal piece in the generator, new terms will almost certainly by generated at every step, and they have to be
truncated. This is not the case with URG or PMS, becasue in those methods, we decouple
just a single-electron at each step, and so those electrons become integrals of motion at
that step, leading to their removal from the off-diagonal piece, and very often the Hamiltonian retains the same form as the bare model. This makes the philosophy of URG and
PMS easier to work with. Tied to this is the fact that CUT RG often takes a certain type
of interaction in the generator part, and not the entire off-diagonal piece. Hence, at the
limit of the flow parameter going to ∞, the chosen off-diagonal piece goes to zero but the
remaining off-diagonal pieces still remain. As a result, the Hamiltonian is atmost block
diagonal at this stage. On the other hand, URG progressively decouples single electrons,
meaning all scattering terms corresponding to that electron vanish at each step.
141

4.4. COMPARISON OF THE CANONICAL TRANSFORMATIONS
One last thing to note is that URG, being unitarily implemented with a well-defined generator, does not accomodate for spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In order to see
SSB, the symmetry-breaking term has to be added to the bare model explicitly; if this
term grows under the RG, then the ground state will be symmetry-broken. CUT RG, however, does allow for SSB through the idea that the generator is not uniquely defined. If
the generator commutes with a particular symmetry, then the family of Hamiltonians
will also have the symmetry [30]. However, if the generator is replaced by something
that is normal ordered w.r.t a particular expectation value, then the CUT RG flow will
usually be towards either the symmetry-preserved state or the symmetry-broken state,
depending on whichever is stable [32].

To obtain the results of Poor Man’s scaling [26][33], we can look at various regimes. First
we look at the case when both 𝜖𝑑 and 𝑈 are small such that both the singly-occupied
and doubly-occupied subspaces of the impurity are comfortably inside the bandwidth,
𝑈, 𝜖𝑑  𝜖𝑞 . We can then ignore the 𝜖𝑑 and 𝑈 in the denominator compared to the 𝜖𝑞 .

certain condition of the couplings. To see this, we apply the particle-hole transformation
𝑐𝑘 → 𝑐𝑘† , 𝑐𝑑 → −𝑐𝑑† to the Hamiltonian. Since we are looking at the impurity symmetry,
we will only look at the terms involving the impurity. The particle-hole symmetry of the
conduction bath is a separate thing and that requires a specific lattice. Hence we will not
consider kinetic energy term in this discussion. The rest of the terms transform as

Chapter 5. URG of the SIAM and its Spin and Charge Generalizations
We dropped some constant terms in the transformed Hamiltonian. For particle-hole
symmetry, the left and right hand sides must be same. The required condition is thus
1

𝜖𝑑 = −𝜖𝑑 − 𝑈 =⇒ 𝜖𝑑 + 𝑈 = 0
2

This same condition can be obtained in a
more physical way. If we consider the singlyoccupied state of the impurity as the reference
state, the doubly-occupied state is the particleexcitation and the vacant state is the hole excitation. The energy of this particle state is
𝐸2 = 2𝜖𝑑 + 𝑈 and that of the hole state is 𝐸0 = 0.
Particle-hole symmetry then requires the particle and hole levels to be degenerate, which
means 𝐸2 = 𝐸0 , and we recover the condition
eq. 5.1.25.

(5.1.25)

Figure 5.1: Particle and hole excitations of the impurity

Since the URG is unitary, if we start from a model that is particle-hole symmetric, the RG
equations should uphold that symmetry. What this means is that if we have 𝜖𝑑 + 21 𝑈 = 0
in the bare model, the new couplings should also satisfy 𝜖0𝑑 + 12 𝑈 0 = 0. This means we must
have



Δ 𝜖𝑑 + 𝑈 = 0
(5.1.26)

The quantity 𝛾 = 𝜖𝑑 + 12 𝑈 is thus an RG-invariant for the particle-hole symmetric model; it
does not change under the RG flow. It is often referred to as the asymmetry parameter;
it quantifies the asymmetry in the model. We need to check if our equations satisfy this.
Looking at the RG equations for 𝜖𝑑 and 𝑈, we can find the RG equation for the asymmetry
parameter. The slightly easier way is to just note that the renormalization in 𝐸2 should
be equal to the renormalization in 𝐸0 , in order for p-h symmetry to hold.

(5.1.27)

If we start with a particle-hole symmetric model, we will have −𝜖𝑑 = 𝜖𝑑 + 𝑈. Substituting
that gives Δ𝐸2 = Δ𝐸0 . This shows that the doublon and holon states remain equidistant
from the single-particle level, thus maintaining particle-hole symmetry along the flow.

Numerical analysis of symmetric SIAM

We will specialize to the particle-hole symmetric case, 2𝜖𝑑 +𝑈 = 0, and a symmetric energy
shell 𝜖𝑞 = 𝐷, and look at the scaling behavior of 𝜖𝑑 .

Depending on the signature of the denominator, the flows will be either relevant or irrelevant. For the flow to the local moment fixed point, the fixed point value of |𝜖𝑑 | grows

Figure 5.2: Left: Irrelevant flow towards |𝜖𝑑 | = 0, at low 𝜔. Right: Relevant flow towards
large |𝜖𝑑 |, at large 𝜔. The former can be thought of as the projection of the strong-coupling
flow on to the 𝜖𝑑 − 𝐷 plane. The latter is the flow towards the local moment fixed point,
if we start from a negative 𝜖𝑑 .
as we increase the bandwidth. This implies that for a thermodynamically large system,
the local moment fixed point will be at −𝜖𝑑 → ∞. This behavior is shown in fig. 5.3.

Anderson-Kondo (spin) model URG

In order to obtain a renormalization in 𝑉 , we will introduce a spin-spin interaction between the impurity and the mobile electrons. Such terms are generated when one does
a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation on the SIAM, but we will find it prudent to keep these
terms in the bare model itself.

scattering momenta or the scattering impurity electrons (𝑘𝜎 → 𝑘0𝜎, 𝑑𝜎0 → 𝑑𝜎0). We label
this coupling as 𝑢𝑃 . The other coupling involves a spin-flip scattering, so we label that as

For the URG, we take two electrons on the shell Λ𝑁 , 𝑞𝛽 and 𝑞𝛽, then decouple the electron
𝑞𝛽. The reason for taking two electrons is to allow the symmetries to be preserved. For
simplicity, we will only consider those diagonal terms in the denominator that either
have both 𝑞𝛽 and 𝑞𝛽 or both 𝑞𝛽 and 𝑑 or both 𝑞𝛽 and 𝑑. Terms that have purely 𝑞𝛽 will
not be considered. Also, the scattering between just 𝑑 and 𝑞𝛽 can be ignored since it is
diagonal in 𝑞𝛽. The Hamiltonian for such a system is

We can read off the renormalizations in the doublon, spin and holon states. Note that the
spin (𝑛ˆ 𝑑 = 1) are only renormalizedby half, because the other half of the renormalization
comes when you decouple the other spin 𝛽.

Particle-Hole symmetry

As discussed in the previous section, the particle-hole symmetry condition for the basic
SIAM (𝐽 = 0) is 𝜖𝑑 + 𝑈 = −𝜖𝑑 . With the inclusion of 𝐽, we will need to see what the new
condition is. We will first write the impurity part of the Hamiltonian and see how it
transforms under a particle-hole transformation.

This gives us the same condition as in the 𝐽 = 0 case. The p-h symmetry condition implies
that 2𝜖𝑑 + 𝑈 must be an RG-invariant. The RG equation for 2𝜖𝑑 + 𝑈 is

For 2𝜖𝑑 + 𝑈 = 0 in the bare model, we can write 𝜉2 = 𝜉10 , which means Δ 2𝜖𝑑 + 𝑈 = 0.

SU(2) invariance and Kondo model one-loop form

Anderson-Kondo (charge) model URG

Performing the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation on the SIAM generates four types of
terms. The simplest terms are ones that renormalize the impurity scales 𝜖𝑑 and 𝑈. The
next are the potential scattering terms that describe interactions between mobile electrons with the impurity simply acting as a stationary potential. The third term is the
familiar Kondo model interaction

As usual, we have considered only one mobile electron on the shell we are decoupling,
and we keep only the energy of that electron and the impurity in the diagonal part which
comes down in the denominator. Note that the factors of half in 𝐶 𝑧 are cancelled by the
factor of 4 in 4 𝐾𝑧 . The last term in H𝑑 is obtained by setting 𝑘 = 𝑘0 = 𝑞 and 𝜎 = 𝛽 in eq. 5.3.3,
and then recognizing that 𝑛ˆ 𝑞𝛽 − 12 = 𝜏𝑞𝛽 . The 𝐾𝑧 part of H𝑋 is obtained by noting:
