Abstract
This thesis reports a renormalization group solution of the single-impurity Anderson
model (SIAM) and its various (mostly low temperature) properties and features. The
method used is a unitary renormalization group technique introduced in Anirban Mukherjee and Siddhartha Lal, Nuclear Physics B, 960, 2020, which block-diagonalizes the Hamiltonian at each step. We first bring out the relation between this method and other unitary methods in the literature like the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, poor man’s scaling and continuous unitary transformation renormalization group. We then apply this
method on a generalized version of the SIAM with explicit spin-exchange and isospinexchange couplings. We find strong-coupling fixed points for both the spin and isospin
couplings. From the zero mode, we then calculate the ground state wavefunctions, which
turnout to be spin singlet and isospin singlet. We also calculate the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat, and extract an effective Hamiltonian for the cloud of electrons that screen the impurity. This Hamiltonian is found to contain both Fermi liquid
and non-Fermi liquid type interactions. We calculate the zero temperature Wilson ratio
from the local Fermi liquid formulation of Nozières, which turns out to be 2 for the Kondo
regime of the SIAM. We also calculate the change in Luttinger’s volume as we move from
the high energy fixed point to the low energy fixed point, and we find that it increases by
1 because the impurity state also gets added to the Fermi volume. The impurity spectral
is tracked between the fixed points and shows the emergence of a central peak at the
strong-coupling fixed point.

3.3 RG flow for the two cases. The green line is the distance between the bare
values of the two couplings, and hence also the magnitude of the denominator. The red arrow denotes the direction in which 𝜖0 will flow. Upward flow
is increase. In both cases, the flow is such that the distance between the
two quantities (and hence the magnitude of the denominator) increases.
The RG fixed point occurs when the magnitude of the denominator goes
to 0. This happens if the distance vanishes. Since the distance necessarily
increases, we cannot get a fixed point in this way. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 106
3.4 RG flow for the two cases with the new −𝜔˜ = 𝜔0 − 12 𝜖+ 14 𝐽. Now we can see that
in both cases, the flow is such that the distance (green dotted line) between
the couplings decreases. A fixed point is reached when this distance vanishes.106

Summary of the problem

The single-impurity Anderson model (SIAM) is one of the most well-studied models in
condensed matter physics and is the prototypical model for magnetism. It shows how
strong correlations between electrons give rise to a residual local moment. Friedel[2], in
1958, gave a phenomenological theory in which a local impurity developed an effective
repulsion which forced the formation of bound states; those bound states where the up
and down states became non-degenerate would correspond to the local moment. Taking
inspiration from this, P.W.Anderson[3] in 1961 designed a model for the formation of local moment in second quantization. The model consisted of a bath of mobile electrons
which interacted with the local impurity. The engine of magnetism was the local onsite
Coulomb repulsion on the impurity site. This repulsion favours the formation of local
moments because it makes it harder for the impurity to be doubly-occupied.
Mean-field calculations of the impurity occupation reveal a criterion for the formation
of local moments; this criterion is similar to the Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism.
This mean-field analysis is of course only valid at high temperatures where electroncorrelations are not so important. At low temperatures, it was found that the resistivity
of the material reaches a minimum at some temperature, and then increases as ln 𝑇 as
we further reduce the temperature. This is in contrast to the previews results. And that
was not all; at a sufficiently low temperature, it was found that the ln 𝑇 -dependence disappears and the susceptibility became constant, implying the formation of a singlet state.
The fact that this logarithmic dependence vanishes once the singlet is formed suggests
that it arises from the local moment on the impurity; once the local moment disappears
(singlet), the log dependence vanishes as well. This led people to design a model in which
the impurity interacted with the conduction bath through a Heisenberg-like spin-spin
interaction. This model can be related to the SIAM through a canonical transformation
followed by a projection to the low energy subspace. In 1964, Jun Kondo[4] found that a
perturbative calculation of the transition probability of electrons from scattering via the
impurity, up to second order in the exchange coupling 𝐽, revealed a logarithmic depen1

1.1. SUMMARY OF THE PROBLEM
dence of the resistivity on temperature. The crucial scattering process was that in which
the spin of the incoming electron flipped (the 𝑆+ 𝑠− and 𝑆− 𝑠+ terms). This explained the
mystery of the resistivity minimum and the logarithmic dependence. But the mystery
of the singlet state at very low temperatures still remained. The perturbative analysis
would break down at low temperatures, so it was unreliable. The log term showed that
the physics of the singlet involved all energy scales; one could not hope to capture it simply by taking the first few terms of a perturbative expansion. This problem came to be
known as the Kondo problem.
In 1970, Anderson attacked this problem by a renormalization group approach to account for all energy scales. In his ”Poor Man’s Scaling” approach, he progressively reduced the bandwidth while taking account of the eliminated states into the couplings
via second order perturbation theory. This showed how the couplings would flow as we
went to low temperatures, but it still could not remove the divergence as it was perturbative. Anderson found that the exchange coupling increased as we go to lower temperatures, so he surmised that the low energy theory was one where 𝐽 = ∞. In 1975, Kenneth Wilson solved the problem by using his numerical renormalization group method
in which he iteratively diagonalized chains of increasing length to go to the low energy
physics. He proved that Anderson’s guess was right and the low energy Hamiltonian was
the same as that with 𝐽 = ∞. Later calculations with Bethe ansatz in 1980 by Andrei and
Wiegmann [5, 6] corroborated Wilson’s findings.
A similar sequence of events also happened in the context of the Anderson model. In
1977 and 1978, Jefferson and Haldane independently calculated the ”Poor Man’s” scaling equations for the asymmetric SIAM, in the limit of infinitely large onsite repulsion.
They were unable to access the strong-coupling fixed point (analogous to the 𝐽 = ∞ fixed
point in Kondo model), but their equations revealed which were the important regimes
to consider. Later, in 1975, Krishnamurthy, Wilkins and Wilson applied the NRG method
to the symmetric Anderson model and obtained the non-perturbative fixed points and
susceptibility [1]. Their calculations were again supported by later Bethe ansatz calculations by Wiegmann and Tsvelick[7].
The physics of the Anderson model and the Kondo model has connotations with quantum
field theory. The numerical renormalization group methods ushered in a revolution.
The idea that physics on all length scales affect the low energy physics was very deep
and has far-reaching consequences. The phenomenon in which the impurity electron
strongly couples to one real space lattice site at low temperatures resulting in the screening of the local moment via spin-flip scatterings with the mobile electrons at that site is
analogous to the phenomenon of quark confinement in which the quarks become bound
at low energies. The high energy fixed point, 𝐽 = 0, corresponds to the phenomenon of
asymptotic freedom in which the interactions between particles become asymptotically
weaker at high temperatures.

Some outstanding questions

Even though the problem of the SIAM has been essentially solved, some questions and
clarifications still remain. In this work, we explore some of these questions.
• Is it possible to get non-perturbative scaling equations for the whole journey? Neither NRG nor Bethe ansatz gives us scaling equations for the RG flows. Poor Man’s
scaling only gives perturbative ones which are valid close to the high energy theories. In the absence of scaling equations that show the complete crossover from the
high energy to the low energy theory, it is difficult to visualize how the Hamiltonian
is precisely chaining.
• Is it possible to show the transfer of spectral weight along the flow, possibly by
tracking the spectral function? Such an exercise will requite the entire spectrum
to be preserved along the flow. NRG, being projective will not work here. If the
entire spectrum is available, computing the spectral function along the flow should
indicate how the spectral weight is being distributed between the impurity and the
conduction bath, or between various states of the impurity. It can also shed light
on which terms or processes in the Hamiltonian contribute to which parts of the
spectral function.
• How does NRG obtain the local moment in the absence of hybridisation? For the
symmetric mode, NRG results show that in the absence of any interaction between
the bath and the impurity, the value of the onsite repulsion flows to a large value
and we end up with a local moment. The obvious question is, how does the impurity
coupling renormalize when there is no term connecting the bath with the impurity?
• Are there any interesting topological aspects of the fixed points? We also intend
to search for the existence of and possible changes in topological quantities at the
fixed points. Since this is a zero-dimensional phenomenon, there will not be any
gapping out of the Fermi surface, but there might be changes in topological quantities related to the Fermi surface or in the analyticity of the Green’s function due to
the presence of the coupling between the bath and the impurity. A strong indication of this is the change in the Wilson ratio from the non-interacting value of 𝑅 = 1
to the local-Fermi liquid fixed point value of 𝑅 = 2 obtained by Nozières[8].
• What is the nature of the Kondo cloud that screens the spin(charge) of the impurity?
We do not yet have a theory for the excitations of the cloud of electrons at the zeroth site that couple to the impurity at the fixed point. The local Fermi liquid sits
just outside the cloud and is able to ”feel” its effects and gauge certain gross quantities like the Wilson ratio, but it does not have the excitations of the cloud because
that part, along with the impurity, has been assumed to be ”frozen” into the singlet
configuration. A recent result in this context [9] is the effective Hamiltonian of the
Kondo model cloud, also obtained using the same method that has been used in this
thesis. The goal here is to do something similar for the SIAM as well.

3

1.3. SALIENT FEATURES OF THE METHOD
• How do entanglement measures respond to the RG flow? Can we find a reflection
of the screening mechanism in something like the mutual information or correlations? This requires a knowledge of the wavefunctions at the fixed point. Does
the enhanced scattering of the electrons off the impurity lead to an increase in the
entanglement between various electrons of the bath? It will also be interesting to
check how various correlation functions vary across the RG flow.

1.3

Salient features of the method

The method employed in this work is a unitary renormalization group (URG) technique
which progressively block-diagonalizes the Hamiltonian in the space of single high energy electrons. At each step of the process, the highest electron is decoupled from the
system and it becomes an integral of motion, and the lower electronic system gets rotated to account for the decoupled electron. In this way, the RG goes on resolving the
number fluctuations of the electrons. A fixed point is reached when the off-diagonal
terms can no longer be removed. Since the method is unitary, it preserves the spectrum
and allows calculating effective eigenvalues and eigenstates. It has some characteristic
features:
• Presence of a quantum fluctuation energy scale 𝜔: The URG process involves a parameter 𝜔 which contains the off-diagonal terms in the Hamiltonian. It quantifies
the quantum fluctuation still unresolved in the system. Exactly at the fixed point,
when the fluctuations are resolved, it assumes the value of one of the energies of
the Hamiltonian. By probing the values of 𝜔, all regions of the spectrum can, at
least in principle, be accessed.
• Presence of finite-valued fixed points: The URG has a definite prescription for reaching the fixed point and it terminates after a finite number of steps (for a finite system). This leads to finite values of the fixed point couplings. This is also in accordance with our intuition that finite systems should not have diverging couplings.
• Spectrum-preserving transformations: Since the RG transformations are unitary, all
eigenvalues and eigenstates are kept track of the in the process. This allows us to
calculate exact quantities for simple systems like the Kondo model.
• Tractable low-energy effective Hamiltonians: The final Hamiltonians obtained at the
fixed point are usually tractable and allow us to extract information.

Layout of the thesis

Chapter 2 goes over the available work on the single-impurity Anderson model and its
derivative - Kondo model. We go over the mean-field calculation of the Anderson model
which gives a criteria for magnetism in terms of the onsite repulsion parameter 𝑈 and the
hybridisation parameter Δ. We then derive the Kondo model from the SIAM by way of a
4

Chapter 1. Introduction
Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, which we solve using NRG. We also spend some time on
the Poor Man’s scaling approaches of both the SIAM and the Kondo model, and end the
chapter with some discussions on the local Fermi liquid aspects of the fixed point theory.
Chapter 3 lays out the URG formalism and prescription. We derive the URG effective
Hamiltonian and the unitaries that perform the RG transformations. We discuss several
important features of the method and provide a prescription for applying it on models.
We also perform the URG explicitly on two models - the star graph model and the Kondo
model. We discuss various subtleties, especially the quantum fluctuation parameter 𝜔
and show that the URG actually diagonalizes the Hamiltonian. We derive many-body
creation and annihilation operators 𝜂† and 𝜂 which rotate the full Hamiltonian into successively more block-diagonal form.
Chapter 4 is closely tied to the formalism chapter and develops the connections between
URG and other canonical transformations in the literature. We first define and setup
each of the other transformations - the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation (SWT), Poor Man’s
scaling (PMS) and the Continuous Unitary Transformation (CUT) RG. We show that all of
these are in some sense perturbative derivatives of URG. A byproduct of the discussion
is a demonstration of the fact that PMS and SWT are exactly identical and differ only in
the contexts in which they are applied. We also discuss the differences between URG and
CUT-RG, and show that URG behaves like a generalized double-bracket flow [10].
Chapter 5 contains the URG analysis of the SIAM and its generalizations, obtained by
adding spin-spin and charge-charge interactions to the SIAM. They lay out the foundation for the URG treatment on the full model with both charge and spin fluctuations. We
derive the RG equations for these separate models in detail and briefly observe how the
couplings flow in certain symmetric settings.
Chapter 6 performs the URG on the full generalized SIAM, obtains the RG equations and
writes down a low-energy effective Hamiltonian for the fixed point theory in the symmetric case. We study the flow of the couplings and identity various fixed points. We also
determine how the fixed point values behave with system size. The low-energy effective
zero-mode Hamiltonian is solved and the ground state wavefunctions are obtained for
both the spin and charge-dominated regimes of the model. We show that a phase transition occurs at some critical value of the couplings, between the spin singlet and the
charge singlet.
Chapter 7 computes some important quantities from the fixed point theory like the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, charge susceptibility, Wilson ratio, Kondo cloud Hamiltonian, entanglement and correlation measures of the Kondo cloud electrons and change
in the Luttinger’s count of the bath. The Kondo cloud Hamiltonian is obtained by tracing
out the impurity operators from the fixed point Hamiltonian. We compute the mutual
information between between various members of the fixed point Hamiltonian, as well
as some off-diagonal correlations. We extract a low temperature local Fermi liquid from
the Hamiltonian which we then use to calculate the zero temperature Wilson ratio for the

Kondo regime of the SIAM. We also calculate the change in Luttinger’s volume between
the fixed points.

1.5

Summary of main results

The first of the main results in this work is the connection between URG and other canonical transformations. It is shown that URG is a non-perturbative variation of the most
general unitary transformation. Other unitary transformations like the Schrieffer-Wolff
transformation and Poor Man’s scaling are simpler forms of URG, obtained by trivializing one of the terms in the Green’s function that comes up in the URG formalism. CUT-RG
is still more different from URG, since it is not only perturbative but also philosophically
different in that it gradually suppresses the off-diagonal terms rather than killing more
and more terms progressively. URG is thus different in two major ways - it provides
non-perturbative equations because of the specific denominator structure as well as accommodates, at least in principle, the feedback effects of the off-diagonal terms through
a quantum fluctuation operator in the denominator.
We next look at the results concerning the SIAM. In the absence of any spin-exchange or
charge isospin-exchange scattering, we do not see any renormalization in the hybridisation and the only flow is towards a local moment fixed point with large impurity onsite
energy 𝑈. In the presence of those additional exchange scattering terms, the corresponding couplings 𝐽(spin exchange) and 𝐾(isospin exchange) flow to large values for low values of 𝜔, signaling strong-coupling fixed points.
At the spin-screened strong-coupling fixed point (𝐽 > 𝐾), the ground state wavefunction
is a superposition of a spin singlet and a charge-isospin triplet. The ground state for the
isospin-dominated fixed point (𝐾 > 𝐽) is an isospin singlet. Thermodynamic quantities
are now calculated using zero-mode Hamiltonians of the low energy effective theories.
The impurity susceptibility 𝜒imp goes to the Curie-Weiss value of a four-fold degenerate
system at large temperatures, and becomes constant (paramagnetic) at very low temper −1
atures. With 𝑇𝐾 defined suitably, 𝜒imp takes the zero temperature value of 2𝜋𝑇𝐾 . The
impurity specific heat has also been calculated, and reveals a two-peak structure.
The fixed-point Hamiltonian further allows us to calculate the impurity spectral function.
For very small 𝑈 we obtain a single-peak structure corresponding to a single spin-spin
or isospin-isospin excitation at the Fermi surface, while two other side-peaks emerge at
large 𝑈 that correspond to excitations between the spin and charge sectors. By tweaking
the values of the couplings in the fixed-point Hamiltonian, we can mimic the reverse RG
flow and see how the impurity spectral function morphs along this journey. Both the
single-peak and three-peak structures revert back to a two-peak spectral function corresponding to that of a local moment.
We then extract the effective Hamiltonian for the Kondo cloud, up to two particle in6

teractions, by tracing out the impurity from the coupled Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian
has both a Fermi liquid piece of the form 𝑛ˆ 𝑘𝜎 𝑛ˆ 𝑞𝜎 0 and a two-particle off-diagonal scattering
† †
piece of the form 𝑐𝑘↑
𝑐𝑘 0↓ 𝑐𝑞↑ 𝑐𝑞0↓. It is the latter which is responsible for the screening mechanism. This conclusion is further strengthened by the studies of entanglement measures
and correlations. The mutual information between the impurity and a cloud electron,
as well as that between two cloud electrons increases as we go from the UV towards the
IR fixed point. The off-diagonal correlation also increases from the UV towards the IR,
which shows that the growth of the off-diagonal term is concomitant with the screening.
We also obtain the Wilson ratio of the impurity by creating a local Fermi liquid from
the fixed point Hamiltonian. Using the zero charge susceptibility at 𝑇 = 0 in the Kondo
regime of the SIAM, we can show that the Wilson ratio goes to 2 at the fixed point. We
also calculate the change in Luttinger’s volume along the RG flow. At the free orbital or
local moment fixed points, the Luttinger’s volume is measured purely by the number of
conduction electrons, but we see that at the strong-coupling fixed point, the correct Luttinger’s volume is given by the total number of electrons in the conduction bath as well
as the impurity. This is also connected to the increase in Wilson ratio from 1 to 2.

Some important results of scattering theory
T-matrix and S-matrix

𝑇 −matrix is defined as[11]

𝑉 |Ψi = 𝑇 |Φi

(2.1.1)

where |Ψi is the total scattered wavefunction and |Φi is the incoming (non-interacting)
wavefunction. This equation is supposed to hold for all eigenkets |Φi of the Hamiltonian
𝐻0 .
The kets |Ψi and |Φi satisfy the Schrodinger equations
𝐻0 |Φi = 𝐸 |Φi
(𝐻0 + 𝑉 ) |Ψi = 𝐸 |Ψi

(2.1.2)
(2.1.3)

We will also define an 𝑆−matrix- it is the unitary operator that relates the non-interacting
eigenstate to the interacting one:
|Ψi = 𝑆 |Φi
(2.1.4)
Since we are assuming elastic scattering, both |Ψi and |Φi have the same energy. The
Schrodinger equation for |Ψi can be rearranged into
|Ψi = |Φi + 𝐺0𝑉 |Ψi

(2.1.5)

where 𝐺0−1 (𝜔) = 𝜔 − 𝐻0 is then on-interacting Greens function. This is also called the
Lippmann-Schwinger equation. Multiplying with the interacting operator 𝑉 from the
left gives
𝑉 |Ψi = 𝑉 |Φi + 𝑉𝐺0𝑉 |Ψi


(2.1.6)
=⇒ 𝑇 |Φi = 𝑉 |Φi + 𝑉𝐺0𝑇 |Φi
eq. 2.1.1
Since the last equation should hold for all |Φi, and since the set of |Φi form a complete
set, we can extract the operator equation
𝑇 = 𝑉 + 𝑉𝐺0𝑇

(2.1.7)

Chapter 2. Preliminaries and Existing Results
The last equation allows us to perturbatively expand the 𝑇 − matrix, by substituting the
RHS into the 𝑇 on the RHS:
(2.1.8)

𝑇 = 𝑉 + 𝑉𝐺0𝑉 + 𝑉𝐺0𝑉𝐺0𝑉 + ...
We can relate this 𝑇 −matrix with the total (interacting) Green’s function
𝐺=

(2.1.9)

𝜔 − 𝐻0 − 𝑉

That definition can be massaged into the following identity:
𝐺 −1 = 𝐺0−1 − 𝑉

(2.1.10)

=⇒ 𝐺0 𝐺 −1 𝐺 = 𝐺0 𝐺0−1 𝐺 − 𝐺0𝑉𝐺
=⇒ 𝐺 = 𝐺0 + 𝐺0𝑉𝐺

By re-substituting 𝐺 into the RHS, this can be made into a perturbative expansion:

𝐺 = 𝐺0 + 𝐺0𝑉 𝐺0 + 𝐺0𝑉𝐺 = 𝐺0 + 𝐺0𝑉𝐺0 + 𝐺0𝑉𝐺0𝑉𝐺0 + ...

(2.1.11)
= 𝐺0 + 𝐺0 𝑉 + 𝑉𝐺0𝑉 + ... 𝐺0

By comparing with eq. 2.1.8, we can recognize the term inside the brackets as the 𝑇 −matrix,
and write
𝐺 = 𝐺0 + 𝐺0𝑇𝐺0
(2.1.12)
By substituting |Ψi = 𝑆 |Φi into the L-S equation, we can also extract a relation between 𝑆
and 𝑇 , and hence between 𝑆 and 𝐺. Combining eqs. 2.1.1,2.1.4 and 2.1.5, we get
𝑆 |Φi = |Φi + 𝐺0𝑇 |Φi
=⇒ 𝑆 = 1 + 𝐺0𝑇

2.1.2

The Friedel sum-rule

This is a very general and important theorem that will come up quite often throughout
the calculations. It states that the change in the number of states of a Hamiltonian on
introduction of a localized scattering center is equal to the sum of the scattering phase
shifts suffered by the conduction electrons at the Fermi surface as they scatter off the
scattering center. We can obtain a clearer picture by looking at a simple derivation of
this result [12].
Consider a Hamiltonian

(2.1.36)

H = 𝐻0 + 𝑉

Í

where 𝐻0 = 𝑘𝜎 𝜖𝑘 𝑛ˆ 𝑘𝜎 . We will define the number of states of the Hamiltonian by integrating over the density of states (dos), which is in turn defined using a retarded Green’s
function. The retarded Green’s function for the full Hamiltonian is defined as
