6.4. EFFECTIVE HAMILTONIAN AND GROUND STATE FOR THE 𝑉 ≠ 0 SYMMETRIC
PROBLEM

The full list of eigenstates is
Although 𝐸−2 is the ground state of this two-dimensional subspace, we haven’t yet checked
what is the true ground state of the full Hilbert space. The eigenstates eq. 6.4.28 through
6.4.30 are obviously higher than 𝐸−2 , because of the presence of the singlet − 43 𝑗 and the
negative 𝛾 contribution in 𝐸−2 compared to the positive triplet contribution 41 𝑗 in those
equations. The only other competitors are the one in eq. 6.4.31 which we call 𝐸 2𝑐 , and the
low energy eigenstate in eq. 6.4.23, which we call 𝐸−1 . We first shown that 𝐸−1 > 𝐸−2 . The
difference between 𝐸−2 and 𝐸−1 is

and we can apply this inequality to the difference between 𝐸−2 and 𝐸−1 to see that 𝐸−2 is
greater that 𝐸−1 .

(6.4.46)

Because of the presence of the large 𝑣 in the first quadrant, this will necessarily be negative there. So, the true ground state in the first quadrant is 𝐸−2 . In the third quadrant, the
large value of 𝑘 will make the difference positive and the true ground state will be the
charge singlet.
These conclusions have been checked numerically and shown in fig. 6.15, where we have
plotted the sign of Δ𝐸 𝑔 as a function of 𝐾0 − 𝐽0 . For positive values of 𝐾0 − 𝐽0 , we are in
the third quadrant, and the sign of Δ𝐸 𝑔 being +1 implies that 𝐸−2 > 𝐸 2𝑐 , and so the third
quadrant ground state is the charge singlet (𝐸 2𝑐 ). On the other hand, as 𝐾0 − 𝐽0 becomes
negative, we move into the first quadrant, and the sign of Δ𝐸 𝑔 also flips, implying that we
188

Chapter 6. URG of Full Generalized SIAM
have a transition from the charge singlet to the (mostly) spin-singlet ground state.
One of the most striking conclusions of this chapter is that the renormalized ground
state of the SIAM in the Kondo regime is purely a singlet. The holon-doublon contributions of the ground state die out in the limit of large system size, and we are left purely
with spin-sector contributions.

Effective Kondo temperature

We now define an energy scale for the low energy fluctuations:

2𝑁 ∗  ∗
(7.1.1)
𝑇𝐾 ≡
𝐷 − 2𝜔
𝜋
The term in brackets, 𝐷∗ − 2𝜔, is the fluctuation energy at the fixed point. The factor
of 2𝑁 ∗ is inserted to make the Kondo temperature intensive (we will see below that the
𝑁 ∗ allows it to be written in terms of parameters of the two-site Hamiltonian) - 2𝑁 ∗ is
the total number of momentum states in the fixed point theory. The factor of 𝜋1 is for
aesthetic reasons. From the fixed-point condition 𝜔 − 𝐷2 + 𝐽+𝐾
= 0, the Kondo temperature

There is an alternate way of calculating this. We insert a fictitious magnetic field that
couples only to the impurity site. The Hamiltonian in the presence of this field is

Since this is in terms of the exact eigenstates, it is a discrete sum of delta-functions. In

convert the discrete sum into a continuous function. Following [39], we replace the deltafunctions by Gaussian functions:

The fixed-point Hamiltonian 𝐻 ∗ is diagonalized numerically to obtain 𝐸𝑚 , |𝑚i . The spectral function is plotted for three sets of bare values in fig. 7.7. For low values of 𝑈, the
profile is that of a single peak at zero frequency. As 𝑈 increases, shoulder-like structures
appear on either side of the peak, which finally, at larger 𝑈, develop into two side-peaks.
The physics of the three peaks can now be looked into. Since the central peak is at zero
energy, it has to do with excitations that do not cost any energy. There are two such
excitations: excitations within the spin sector and within the charge sector.

The thick arrow ⇑ represents the charge isospin. At particle-hole symmetry, both the spin
configurations has energy of 𝜖𝑑 , while the charge configurations have energy of 2𝜖𝑑 +𝑈 = 0
and 0. Hence, no energy is required for these excitations, which is why see a macroscopic
number of cloud electrons resonating with the impurity at the Fermi surface. Also note
that if 𝑆ˆ𝑖 and 𝐶ˆ 𝑗 are two operators of the spin and charge sector (𝑖, 𝑗 ∈ 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧 ), then
𝑆ˆ𝑖 𝐶ˆ 𝑗 = 𝐶ˆ 𝑗 𝑆ˆ𝑖 = 0
202

(7.5.16)

Chapter 7. Results and Features of the Low-Energy Theory
We can see this by applying that operator on a basis state. Since the set of four states
1

| 𝑆ˆ𝑖 = ± , 𝐶ˆ 𝑗 = 0i , | 𝑆ˆ𝑖 = 0, 𝐶ˆ 𝑗 = ± i

(7.5.17)

are all independent, they form a basis. If we apply the operator on these states:
𝑆ˆ𝑖 𝐶ˆ 𝑗 | 𝑆ˆ𝑖 i = 0,

𝐶ˆ 𝑗 𝑆ˆ𝑖 |𝐶 𝑗 i = 0,

𝐶ˆ 𝑗 𝑆ˆ𝑖 |𝑆𝑖 i = 𝑆𝑖 𝐶ˆ 𝑗 |𝑆𝑖 i = 0

𝑆ˆ𝑖 𝐶ˆ 𝑗 | 𝐶ˆ 𝑗 i = 𝐶 𝑗 𝑆ˆ𝑖 |𝐶ˆ 𝑗 i = 0

(7.5.18)

This shows that each operator acts only on its own subspace. 𝑆𝑖 does not act on the charge
sector, and vice-versa. There is no single-particle excitation here.
The physics of the side-peaks is that of single number fluctuations on the impurity. These
are brought about by the term 𝑉 𝑐0†𝜎 𝑐𝑑𝜎 + h.c..

(7.5.19)

These transitions involve energy transfer of the order of 𝜖𝑑 . This is why, at very small 𝑈,
they remain absorbed inside the central peak. These transitions do not involve any spin
or charge-flip, rather they take the impurity between the spin and charge sectors.

7.6

Renormalization of impurity spectral function

Another interesting study that we conducted is the change in the spectral function under
revere-RG. Doing the actual reverse RG would require diagonalizing a huge matrix. Instead, we mimic the reverse journey by starting from the fixed point and then increasing
the 𝑈 (it was irrelevant in the forward RG) and decreasing 𝐽 (it was relevant in the forward RG). The spectral function is then calculated at these points. The result is shown in
fig. 7.8. At the strong-coupling fixed-point, we have a screened-local moment which only
has a zero-energy excitation at the Fermi energy. As we move away from the fixed-point,
the resonance at the Fermi surface disappears, and is replaced by two side peaks which
are indicative of the two orientations of a local moment.

This interaction arises from the enhanced entanglement between the impurity and the
conduction electrons; removing the impurity from the singlet and the triplet generates
these off-diagonal scatterings. As such, this is an indicator of the macroscopic entanglement of the singlet formed at the IR fixed point, and plotted in fig. 7.13.
It is also very enlightening to note that this scattering is a signature of the change in
Luttinger’s count in going from the free orbital or local moment fixed point to the strongcoupling fixed point, as shown in eq. 7.9.28. Both this off-diagonal scattering as well as
the change in Luttinger’s count are a direct consequence of the non-number conserving
term 𝑉 𝑐𝑘† 𝑐𝑑 in the full Hamiltonian. The topological change of Luttinger’s count is concomitant with the presence of the off-diagonal scattering term in the effective Hamiltonian. Just the Fermi liquid piece in eq. 7.7.23 will give neither the enhanced mutual information nor the change in Luttinger’s count.
We have shown the enhancement of this off-diagonal scattering during the flow towards
the IR fixed point by computing it during the reverse RG program, in fig. 7.9. It is clear
from this plot that the growth of this non-Fermi-liquid type interaction happens simultaneously with the formation of the singlet.

Calculation of Wilson ratio from effective local Fermi
liquid

In this section, we will calculate the zero temperature Wilson ratio of the impurity in the
Kondo regime of the SIAM. Since this is a low energy property, our starting point will be
the fixed point Hamiltonian of eq. 6.4.3, after substituting 𝑈 ∗ = 𝐾 ∗ = 0 (because we are in
the first quadrant):

We know that the ground state for the interacting part is predominantly the spin-singlet
(it was shown while calculating the ground states of the effective zero-mode Hamiltonian
that the ground state is a mixture of singlet and triplet, and the triplet part dies out at
large system sizes, see eq. 6.4.40), so we will take that as our reference state and treat the
hopping part that connects the origin to the first site,

as a weak perturbation. 𝑟®1 here sums over the sites that are nearest to the origin. Once
that is taken care of, we will have a decoupled singlet formed by the impurity and the zeroth site, and the rest of the lattice formed by 𝑁 −1 sites along with the interaction induced
by the perturbation. The goal here is to see whether the effect of the perturbation is to
lower the energy of the singly-occupied state | 𝑛ˆ 1 = 1i compared to the doubly-occupied
state | 𝑛ˆ 1 = 2i or to raise it. If the perturbation shifts the energy of the singly-occupied
state below the doubly-occupied state, then we can conclude that the effect of the perturbation is to raise the energy of the doubly-occupied state, which can then be modeled
by a repulsive term |𝑈 | 𝑛ˆ 1↑ 𝑛ˆ 1↓. If, on the other hand, the effect is to raise the energy of the
singly-occupied state with respect to the 𝑛ˆ 1 = 2 state, then that effect is equivalent to an
attractive term −|𝑈 | 𝑛ˆ 1↑ 𝑛ˆ 1↓.
To be precise, we will compare the energy shifts corresponding to the two states
