where 𝑇 is the 𝑇 −matrix for scattering of conduction electrons off the impurity. From
the optical theorem, we know that the 𝑆−matrix (𝑆(𝜔) ≡ 𝑒2𝑖𝛿(𝜔) ) is related to the 𝑇 −matrix

The case of h𝑛𝑑 i = 1
Exactly at the strong-coupling fixed point, for particle-hole symmetry, we expect the occupancy of the impurity to be h𝑛𝑑 i = 1, because the singly-occupied state is below the
Fermi level while the doubly occupied state is above. If we now lower the Fermi level
by Δ𝜇 while keeping the particle-hole symmetry intact (by suitably shifting the impurity
levels), the resonance in the spectral function at the Fermi surface will persist, because
the electrons at the Fermi surface will always form a singlet with the impurity and go
into a bound state.
Since the energies are measured relative to the Fermi level, all quasiparticle energies will
increase by Δ𝜖𝑘𝜎 = Δ𝜇. However, some of the quasiparticles closer to the Fermi surface
will now come below it,so that the number of quasiparticles will decrease by Δ𝑛 = −Δ𝜇𝜌𝑑 ( 0).
The net change in 𝑛↑ is thus
Δ𝑛↑ = 𝛿𝑛↑ (𝜖𝑘↑ + 𝜇) − 𝛿𝑛↑ (𝜖𝑘↑)

(2.6.35)

At the Kondo limit, the impurity occupation is fixed at 1 because the resonance in the
spectral function of the conduction electrons is pinned at the Fermi energy. This means
that even if we shift the Fermi energy, the resonance moves with it, and there should be
no change Δ𝑛↑. Hence,
1 − 𝑈 𝜌𝑑 ( 0) = 0 =⇒ 𝑈 𝜌𝑑 ( 0) = 1
(2.6.36)
Substituting h𝑛𝑑𝜎 i = 12 and 𝜖𝑑 = − 𝑈2 in the density of states eq. 2.6.7 gives 𝜌𝑑 ( 0) =

We note that this connection between 𝑅 and Δ𝑉𝐿 has not been obtained in the existing

electronic state from the impurity has been absorbed into the Luttinger volume of the
conduction bath), such that 𝑅 = 2 in this limit. In this way, we see that a change in the
topological quantum number 𝑁˜ causes the well known renormalisation of the Wilson
ratio R from its non-interacting value ( 1) to the value ( 2) obtained for the local Fermi
liquid [8].

2.8. RENORMALIZED PERTURBATION THEORY

2.8

Renormalized perturbation theory

This is a perturbative expansion of the Hamiltonian in terms of the renormalized interace, and the second order results obtained from this approach coincide with the phetion 𝑈
nomenological results at 𝑇 , ℎ → 0.. This approach is obviously more general as all terms
in the original Hamiltonian are retained. This is an alternative to the full microscopic
approach. In the microscopic approach, we take the exact microscopic Hamiltonian and
calculate observables from it. In the renormalized perturbation, we separate the Hamiltonian into a non-interacting quasiparticle Hamiltonian which is like the low-energy free
Hamiltonian, and an interacting part, and also a counter-term to prevent divergences.
The original parameters of the model get replaced by renormalized parameters, and we
can analyze the model perturbatively in powers of the renormalized interaction.
To do a perturbative expansion of the Hamiltonian in terms of the interaction 𝑈, it is
useful to introduce the self energy Σ(𝐸) = Σ( 0) + 𝐸Σ0 + Σrem (𝐸). In the absence of interaction, the impurity Green’s function is
𝐺𝑑0 =

h𝑛𝑑𝜎 i = h𝑛0𝑑𝜎 i, that is, the quasiparticle distribution becomes the same as the free fermionic

Poor Man’s scaling of the SIAM

First consider the case in which 𝜖𝑑  −𝐷, 𝑈 + 𝜖𝑑  𝐷. The situation is such that both the
impurity levels are fat outside the bandwidth, as shown in fig. 2.2a. The maximum energy scale at which scattering with conduction electrons can take place is of the order
of the bandwidth 𝐷. Since the impurity energies are much higher than the bandwidth,
no charge fluctuation can take place. The impurity state will be fixed at 𝜖𝑑 . The only
remaining degree of freedom will be the spin fluctuations, and we can then do the S-W
transformation.
71

2.9. POOR MAN’S SCALING OF THE SIAM
On the other hand, if we take the situation in fig. 2.2b where both the impurity levels
are far inside the bandwidth, then both the impurity levels will be on energy scales completely different from the bandwidth. So there wont be any renormalization of the impurity levels. From another perspective, it can be said that there won’t be any renormalization because both the impurity levels | 0i , | 1i will be able to hybridise with two
states each: | 0i can hybridize with |𝑘 ↑i , |𝑘 ↓i and | 1𝜎i can hybridize with | 0i , | 2i. The

This means that the doubly-occupied state is decoupled from the conduction band; it cannot hybridize through the 𝑉𝑘𝑑 because the virtual transition will involve a huge amount

There are two things to note here. Firstly, 𝛼𝑘𝜎 is the probability of such a virtual transition

To see the renormalization of 𝑉𝑘𝑑 , we need to consider one order higher. These higher
order terms involve transitions within the lower subspace along with virtual transitions
into the higher subspaces.

This result is in the regime 𝑈 + 𝜖𝑑  𝐷  |𝜖𝑑 |. Even if 𝑈  𝐷 initially, scaling will begin
once 𝐷 ∼ 𝑈. Until then, as mentioned previously, both 𝜖1 and 𝜖0 will change equally and
there won’t be any scaling in 𝜖𝑑 . If we start with 𝑈  𝐷, under scaling, as 𝐷 will decrease,
there won’t be any renormalization until we reach the point 𝐷 ∼ 𝑈.
Say, as a result of scaling, the bandwidth decreases and 𝜖𝑑 increases (which it will, as is
apparent from the eq. 2.9.23). At some point, −𝐷 ≲ 𝜖𝑑 . At this point, perturbation theory
breaks down and we resort to SWT. We denote this point of the scaling by 𝐷 = −𝑎e
𝜖 𝑑 , 𝑎 > 1.

The two forms of the Kondo temperature show that the prefactor is not a universal function; it depends on the starting conditions (the microscopic Hamiltonian from which we
start the scaling). But the universal fact is that in the local moment regime (𝑈 → ∞), all
physical quantities will involve only one energy scale, 𝑇𝐾 . This 𝑇𝐾 itself might be different
based on the starting Hamiltonian.
For 𝜖∗𝑑  Δ, the renormalization will stop at 𝐷 ∼ 𝜖𝑑 . Note that we had assumed 𝐷  𝜖𝑑 .
That was the starting condition, that is, 𝜖𝑑 deep inside the Fermi surface. During the
renormalization, 𝐷 will keep on decreasing and 𝜖𝑑 will continuously increase. At some
value of 𝐷, they will become equal and the impurity level will go outside the Fermi surface. At this point, none of the impurity levels can renormalize any more, because the
relevant energy scales are greater than the cutoff. Hence the renormalization stops at
this point. This point is given by 𝐷 = 𝑎𝜖𝑑 (𝐷) ≡ 𝜖𝑑 where 𝑎 is a constant of order unity. It
satisfies the equation

which is just eq. 2.9.23 with the substitution 𝐷 = 𝑎𝜖𝑑 . In this regime, because 𝜖𝑑  Δ, we

where I used the fact that ln 𝑎 will be of order 1. As we go on decreasing the cutoff,
the impurity level will go on moving farther away from the Fermi level, and impurity
site will become null occupied: h𝑛𝑑 i ≈ 0. The critical cutoff 𝐷 can be associated with a
temperature scale 𝑘𝑏𝑇 = 𝐷. At temperatures sufficiently below this temperature (𝑇  𝑇 ),
the susceptibility becomes (again from perturbation theory)

This is analogous to the result obtained in eq. 2.6.20, from the mean field version of the
Fermi liquid theory, and also obtained from a renormalized perturbation theory of Anderson model. To see how, note that since we are in the limit h𝑛𝑑 i = 0, the onsite repulsion

which is the same as eq. 2.9.34. This tells us that scaling all the way down to very low
temperatures in regime 𝜖∗𝑑  Δ brings us into a Fermi liquid state, characterized by a
temperature-independent susceptibility (as is standard in a Fermi liquid). The crossovers
can be seen by looking at the variation of the Curie constant 𝜒𝑇 .
Since the susceptibility is proportional to the magnetic moment, presence of degeneracy
will reduce this moment because the probability of occupying the states will decrease. As
a result, the Curie constant is also a measure of the effective degeneracy of the impurity
orbital. At very high temperatures 𝑇  𝑈, 𝜖𝑑 , all the impurity levels 0, 𝜖𝑑 and 2𝜖𝑑 + 𝑈 will
become degenerate on energy scales of the order of 𝑘 𝐵𝑇 . As a result, the Curie constant
is approximately 81 in this range. The impurity occupancy is 𝑛𝑑 = 1, because there are 4
degenerate states and the average number of electrons on them is 1. At lower temperatures 𝑈  𝑇  𝑇 ∗ , the degeneracy gets lowered; now, only the vacant and single-occupied
states are degenerate. Here the Curie constant is 16 . In this case, the average occupancy
is 𝑛𝑑 = 0+31+1 = 23 . At still lower temperatures, we saw that the impurity becomes vacant
and 𝑛𝑑 = 0. The Curie constant becomes linear in temperature, going down to 0. More

Next we consider the mixed valence regime, described by |𝜖∗𝑑 | < Δ. It is clear that since
the impurity level is within an interval of the hybridisation from the Fermi surface, the
charge fluctuations can cause transitions between the various states of the impurity. This
means that the occupation number of the impurity site is not a good quantum number in
this regime, and the average number of impurity electrons will be fractional. This definition is a bit arbitrary because any observed sample will display an eigenstate in which
the impurity states have contributions from both h𝑛𝑑 i = 0 and h𝑛𝑑 i = 1, so any sample will
be mixed in that sense. However, if we are not in the mixed valence regime (|𝜖𝑑 |  Δ),
then the contribution from any one state will far outweigh the other. If 𝜖𝑑 > 0, then the
impurity level is far above the Fermi level and it will most probably not be occupied and
the majority of the contribution will come from h𝑛𝑑 i = 0. Similarly, if 𝜖𝑑 < 0, then the impurity level is far below the Fermi level and the average occupation will be close to 1.
The regime of mixed valence is one in which these two contributions are comparable.

Since we have |𝜖∗𝑑 | ≲ Δ, as we renormalize, the decreasing cutoff will first match Δ or
𝑘 𝐵𝑇 , whichever is greater. From eq. 2.9.19, we know that if 𝐷 comes close to Δ, our analysis will break down because we can no longer ignore that term. Since that term represents the broadening of the impurity level, this same broadening can also be brought
about by the thermal fluctuations which are of the scale 𝑘 𝐵𝑇 . This means that real valence fluctuations
will now renormalize the potential 𝑉𝑘𝑑 . Hence, our analysis will stop

at 𝐷 = max Δ, 𝑘 𝐵𝑇 . For the simpler situation in which 𝑇 = 0, the renormalization will
stop at 𝐷 = Δ. From eq. 2.9.23, putting 𝐷 = Δ, we get

Figure 2.3: Renormalization in energy levels when |𝜖∗𝑑 | ≲ Δ
This is the renormalized impurity level in the mixed valence regime. A characteristic
feature of this regime is that the charge fluctuations can be thermally excited. This can
be seen as follows. The probability of a transition from, say, |𝑛𝑑 = 0i to |𝑛𝑑 = 1i is

Assuming the thermal fluctuations are more or less of the order Δ, for 𝜖𝑑  Δ, this transition will not be possible. However, in the mixed valence regime, because 𝜖𝑑 ∼ Δ, these
excitations do occur. These fluctuations, as well as the ones from the hybridisation with
the conduction band, are responsible for the mixing of the singly-occupied and nulloccupied states.
The crossovers in the mixed valence regime are as follows. Similar to the previous case,
at high and intermediate temperatures, we have 𝑛𝑑 = 1 and 𝑛𝑑 = 23 respectively. However,
while the triplet degeneracy lasted upto 𝑇 ∼ 𝑇 ∗ in the previous case, here it continues up
to 𝑇 ∼ Δ because that is where the scaling breaks down. That is, 𝑇 = Δ is the point where
we can no longer ignore the renormalization in 𝑉 and it begins to increase with scaling.
Beyond this point, the impurity occupation remains fractional and not much else can be
said.

only through their spins; their is no charge fluctuation. At high temperatures 𝑇  𝑇𝐾 ,
the impurity is essentially decoupled and we get a susceptibility of the form eq. 2.9.49,
but with a degeneracy of 2. To go to lower temperatures, we can do a Poor Man’s scaling
which suggests that the Hamiltonian at 𝑇  𝑇𝐾 is one with a large coupling between the
impurity and the conduction electrons.

Before scaling, 𝑉 + = 𝑉 − = 𝑉 . The Schrödinger equation we want to solve is
𝐻𝜓 = 𝐸𝜓

(2.9.63)

We know the eigenstates 𝜓0 of 𝐻0 . They are the states {|𝑛𝑘𝑖 𝜎 , 𝑛𝑑𝜎 0 i}. These states of course
span the entire Hilbert space. A subset of these states form the model subspace. We call
these states 𝜙. For our case, that is the subspace with all conduction electrons inside
𝐷 − 𝛿𝐷. The projection operator for this subspace is

(2.9.65)

If the dimension of model subspace if 𝑑, we can say that 𝑃 takes 𝑑 eigenstates 𝜓 of the
total Hamiltonian to 𝑑 eigenstates in the model subspace:
𝑃{𝜓} 𝑑 = {𝜙}

(2.9.66)

This is of course true in the non-interacting limit. There, the 𝜓0 are the exact eigenstates,
and the action of 𝑃 is basically
𝑃𝜓0

|𝑘|<𝐷−𝛿𝐷

= 𝜓0

|𝑘|<𝐷−𝛿𝐷

(2.9.67)

Now, as we turn on the interactions adiabatically, it is safe to assume that these 𝑑 noninteracting eigenstates flow into 𝑑 interacting eigenstates. This means that we can define
an inverse for the 𝑃 operator which takes a non-interacting eigenstate from the model
subspace into the interacting eigenstate:
Ω{𝜙} = {𝜓}

(2.9.68)

Since Ω can only act on states in the model subspace, we define
Ω{𝜙}⊥ = 0

(2.9.69)

Ω𝑃𝜙 = Ω𝜙
Ω𝑃𝜙 = Ω × 0 = 0 = Ω𝜙⊥

(2.9.70)
(2.9.71)

This allows us to write
⊥

In the first equation, I used 𝑃𝜙 = 𝜙 because the projection of 𝜙 into the model subspace is
𝜙 itself. Together these two identities give
Ω𝑃 = Ω

(2.9.72)

With these definitions, we now change the problem a bit. We want to solve the Schrödinger
equation only in the model subspace. To this end we write the Schrödinger equation as
𝐻Ω𝜙 = 𝐸ΩΦ

(2.9.73)

Since we want to write down an equation only in the model subspace, the equation
should operate only on the 𝜙. To remove the Ω on the right side, operate on this equation
with 𝑃 from the left. This gives
𝑃𝐻Ω𝜙 = 𝐸𝑃Ω𝜙 = 𝐸𝜙

(2.9.74)

2.9. POOR MAN’S SCALING OF THE SIAM
This is the effective Schrödinger equation in the model subspace. The effective Hamiltonian for the model subspace is
𝐻eff = 𝑃𝐻Ω = 𝑃𝐻0 𝑃 + 𝑃𝑉 Ω = 𝑃𝐻0 𝑃 + 𝑃𝑉 Ω

(2.9.75)

To solve for the Ω, apply eq. 2.9.72 on the Schrödinger equation (𝐸 − 𝐻0 )𝜓 = 𝑉 𝜓:
Ω𝑉 𝜓 = (𝐸Ω𝑃 − Ω𝑃𝐻0 )𝜓

(2.9.76)



Now, since 𝑃 is made up of the eigenstates of 𝐻0 , those two will commute: 𝐻0 , 𝑃 = 0. The
equation then becomes
Ω𝑉 𝜓 = (𝐸 − Ω𝐻0 𝑃)𝜓

We can now expand the effective Hamiltonian in powers of 𝑉 . From eq. 2.9.75, the interacting part of the effective Hamiltonian becomes

These results have been more or less general. We now need to write these in terms of
the creation and annihilation operators of our Hamiltonian. The model subspace for our

problem is the part of the conduction band up to 𝐷 − 𝛿𝐷. Here on, represent sum over
Í0
the model subspace momenta and
represent sum over the remaining momenta. To
facilitate writing the effective Hamiltonian in terms of the creation and annihilation operators, we change the projection operators from the bra-ket representation to operator

None of the four final states belong to the model subspace, so this term is zero.

• 𝑘 is close to the Fermi level (𝜖𝑘 ≈ 0)

• Since we truncated at third order, we need 𝐷 − |𝜖𝑑 |  𝑣± . This gives us 𝐷  |𝜖𝑑 |.
