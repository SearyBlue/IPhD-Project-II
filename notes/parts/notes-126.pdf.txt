Numerical Solutions

The symmetric scaling equation 3.4.28 was solved numerically with the choice 𝜔 = − 2𝑞 ,
for both positive and negative bare values of 𝐽. For sufficiently low values of 𝜔, the
Kondo coupling 𝐽 flows to the strong-coupling limit. This limit, as obtained from the
URG, is of course finite. This can be reconciled with the NRG result 𝐽 ∗ = ∞ by noting the
fact that increasing the bare bandwidth 𝐷 does increase the value of URG 𝐽 ∗ , such that in
the thermodynamic limit 𝐷 → ∞, URG should give 𝐽 ∗ → ∞. This is shown in fig. 3.8

Figure 3.7: Flow of 𝐽 towards the strong-coupling fixed point (right) and the weak coupling saddle-point (left). The x-axis indicates the index of the energy shell being decoupled. The largest value (UV) is the first step, and we go towards the left (IR).

Poor Man’s Scaling

We first motivate the formalism of PMS method. The problem is defined as
H |Ψi = 𝐸 |Ψi

(4.1.1)

H is the total Hamiltonian and |Ψi and 𝐸 are the exact eigenstate and eigenvalue of H .
We imagine a separation of the total Hilbert space into two set of states, and we call these
two states | 0i and | 1i. This separation depends on which scattering term we want to kill
by this transformation. For example, in the URG, we typically select a particular electron 𝑞𝛽 and then kill the scattering terms
that change
n
o the number of this state. In that
case, | 0i will refer to the set of states | 𝑛ˆ 𝑞𝛽 = 0i ⊗ |𝜙0 i and | 1i will refer to the set of states
n
o
| 𝑛ˆ 𝑞𝛽 = 1i ⊗ |𝜙1 i . |𝜙0,1 i refer to the states of all the other electrons. As another example, if
we wanted to separate the charge-Kondo and the spin-Kondo from the SIAM, we would
want to kill the terms that scatter between the spin-full subspace 𝑛ˆ 𝑑 = 1 to the spin-less
subspace 𝑛ˆ𝑑 = 0, 2. These two will then be the | 0i and | 1i sets.
Keeping this separation in mind, the exact eigenstate |Ψi can be split as

The Hamiltonian can also be split as

H = 𝐻0 + 𝑉+ + 𝑉−

𝐻0 does not scatter between | 0i and | 1i . It contains the diagonal parts as well as
scatterings inside the subspaces. 𝑉± scatter between the subspaces:

This is a general expression that would work irrespective of whether you are decoupling

prescription for replacing them. Since the 𝐸 is the eigenstate of the initial state on which
the scattering terms act, it makes sense to replace them with the initial state energy.

In summary, the prescription of replacing all 𝜔 with the initial state energy will be correct only if the initial and final states are the same. This happens when we are decoupling
a single-electron state - then the total renormalization is of the form 𝑐†𝑇 † 𝑐 such that we
start from an initial state, scatter to an intermediate state and then go back to the initial

state so that the final state is the same as the initial state. However, if we are using PMS
to decouple states in one-shot, each subspace will have multiple states and there might
be terms where we do not end up at the initial state we started with. Then the correct
prescription would be to use the mean of the initial and final state denominators.
To make a better connection with URG, we next show how the PMS formalism works
out for a single-electron decoupling.
We want to decouple one electron at momentum 𝑞. We can split the exact wavefunction as
|Ψi = |Ψ0 i + |Ψ1 i
(4.1.18)


where |Ψ0 i = 1 − 𝑛ˆ 𝑞 |Ψ 𝑁 i is that part of the wavefunction where the state 𝑞 is occupied.

|Ψ1𝑁 i = 𝑛ˆ 𝑞 |Ψi is that part of the wavefunction where the state 𝑞 is occupied. We can also
split the Hamiltonian as
(4.1.19)
H = H 𝑑 + 𝑉0 + 𝑉+ + 𝑉−

H 𝑑 is the diagonal part; it has the purely energy terms as well as self-energies that may
arise from the diagonal parts of interactions; 𝑉0 is the purely off-diagonal term that does
not change 𝑛ˆ 𝑞 ; it is the scattering inside the low energy subspace. 𝑉+ and 𝑉− are the purely
off-diagonal terms that do change 𝑛ˆ 𝑞 ; 𝑉+ takes you from 𝑛ˆ 𝑞 = 0 to 𝑛ˆ 𝑞 = 1 and 𝑉− does the
opposite.
Substituting eqs. 4.1.19 and 4.1.18 in eq. 4.1.1 gives

It can be shown that if we define a unitary operator 𝑈 = 1 − 𝜂 + 𝜂† , the transformed
Hamiltonian 𝑈H𝑈 † is the same as eq. 4.1.31. This, along with the properties of 𝜂, have
been shown in section 3. The important feature of eq. 4.1.31 is that there is no term in
the transformed Hamiltonian which scatters between |Ψ0 i and |Ψ0 i- the two subspaces
have been truly decoupled.

and again repeat the entire process. H̃0 now takes the place of H and |Ψ0 i takes the place
of |Ψi in eq. 4.1.1.

The expression for URG is obtained in an almost identical way. The only difference is
that instead of starting with the exact eigenpair (𝐸, |Ψi), we start with a more general

Summarizing, the general Hamiltonian is not diagonal in the Fock space basis. URG,
in order to proceed, selects one non-Fock basis of states |Φi such that 𝑞 is decoupled in
that Hamiltonian. Since there can be lots of such basis, there is a freedom in this choice.
With this basis in mind, URG then finds a unitary operator which when operated on the
Hamiltonian takes us to the form in which it is diagonal in the Fock space basis. Note that
this form is a function of the chosen |Φi. We then select the second degree of freedom
and repeat the process. What PMS does is, it exploits the freedom of choice and selects
the exact eigenstate |Ψi of the Hamiltonian as the non-Fock basis |Φi. Doing that returns
a rotated Hamiltonian which is diagonal in 𝑞, and is a function of the chosen state, same
as URG. The conclusion is that depending on which state we choose as our diagonal nonFock basis, URG and PMS will cause flows along different lines in general.

Figure 4.1: Flows of PMS(green) and URG(blue)
This means that one of the eigenvalues of 𝜔ˆ matches with the eigenvalue of the diagonal
part H 𝑑 , either in the occupied sector (H1𝑑 ) or unoccupied sector (H1𝑑 ). Since the eigenvalues are unchanged during the unitary renormalization, this implies that 𝜔 takes up
one of the eigenvalues of the whole Hamiltonian H . This will correspond to the fixed
point obtained from PMS if we had started PMS with that eigenvalue.
In short, while the PMS flow is parametrised by one of the exact energy eigenvalues
𝐸, the URG flow is parametrised by a non-trivial operator 𝜔ˆ which incorporates both a
diagonal part and an off-diagonal part and itself flows under the URG. At the fixed point,
the off-diagonal part cancels out and the 𝜔ˆ finally flows to one of the energy eigenvalues
and the URG fixed point matches with one of the PMS fixed points.

Some conclusions:
• The only difference in the formalism of PMS and URG is that while PMS uses the exact energy eigenvalue 𝐸 to parameterise the flow, URG uses a general intermediate
decoupled Hamiltonian to do the same. Since the 𝐸 is also, technically, an intermediate decoupled Hamiltonian (it is the final Hamiltonian), PMS can be seen as an
URG but with a specific choice for the paramter.

• In practise, PMS replaces 𝐸 − 𝑉0 with the diagonal part of the initial state at the
current step of the RG. We are talking about the energy of the initial state, not the
intermediate state. This is because, from eq. 4.1.1, 𝐸 is the energy of the initial state
on which 𝑉± act.
• The ideal solution would have been to substitute the exact energy and the total scattering term 𝑉 , but since we do not know 𝐸 and keeping the 𝑉 would make the thing
untractable, we use our current best guess (renormalised diagonal part). As the RG
flows, both 𝐸 𝑗 and 𝑉 flow, such that at the fixed point, 𝑉 becomes zero (scattering
terms get removed) and 𝐸 𝑗 morphs into the exact 𝐸.
• In practise, URG replaces the 𝜔ˆ with a guess for the final energy 𝐸. This however
ˆ A better approach would be to replace it with 𝐸 𝑗 ,

following PMS. That would act like the one-particle renormalization of 𝜔.
• PMS usually drops any diagonal component of the scattering from the denominator. For example, in the PMS of the Kondo model by Anderson [3] or that of the
anisotropic power law Kondo model by Chenge et.al [28], they do not keep the term
𝐽𝑧 𝑆𝑑𝑧 𝑠 𝑧 in the denominator although it is number(spin) conserving. Such terms are
kept in the denominator of the URG though. It must be mentioned however that
ref. [29] does bring a diagonal charge-charge interaction in the denominator in the
PMS of the extended Anderson model.

We have a general Hamiltonian

(4.2.1)

H = H0 + H𝑋

H0 is diagonal w.r.t a particular degree of freedom. 𝑉 is off-diagonal w.r.t that same
degree of freedom. Let 𝑆 be an anti-Hermitian and off-diagonal operator. 𝑈 = 𝑒𝑆 is then a
unitary transformation.

(4.2.16)

The differences between the perturbative and non-perturbative ways are summarized
in table 4.1. There appear to be two differences between these decoupling conditions:
(a) a pre-factor of 𝜋4 for the first term on the right hand side, and (b) the altogether new
second term on the right hand side. Both are outcomes of the non-perturbative nature
of URG. This offers evidence that the physics captured by the effective Hamiltonian (and
its associated low-energy many-particle Hilbert space) obtained from URG lies well beyond that obtained from SWT. Further, it shows that the SWT can only be justified as an
expansion in a small parameter (say, 𝑈1 ) in the Anderson impurity problem), followed by
a truncation of the BCH expansion and a projection onto a particular low-energy subspace. The truncation and projection are adopted simultaneously, and appear to impose
the limit of 𝑈 = ∞ by hand. The URG flow never attains such a limit, thus suggesting
that there exists a lot of interesting physics that could potentially be lost in the SWT procedure. Further, the projection finally applied within SWT means that we can never
recover what is thrown away. This is again not the case with URG.
Renormalization due to SWT and Comparison with PMS and URG
Similar to the situation in Poor Man’s scaling, one can visualize two set of states and let
H𝑋 = 𝑉+ + 𝑉− be the scattering that connects them and hence the one we want to kill. Let
𝑆 be of the form

𝑆=

This form is of course chosen to make 𝑆 anti-Hermitian and off-diagonal. The part 𝑠 can
be determined from the decoupling condition:

We can transform the URG result to the SWT result if we ignore the effect of the quantum
fluctuations in 𝜔 (arising from the presence of the off-diagonal term H 𝑖 ) and replace it
with the renormalised diagonal value of − 21 𝜖𝑞 . This means that SWT tracks the effect of
the off-diagonal terms only in the numerator. Of course, all this assumes we are doing
an iterative SWT instead of a one-shot SWT; the latter is the conventional way. A second
difference is that URG has a Green’s function like structure in the renormalization such
that a fixed point is reached when the diagonal part H 𝑑 matches one of the eigenvalues
of 𝜔 (see 3.1.6). SWT does not have such a fixed point structure.
Another point to note is that decoupling a single electron does not generate all the chargecharge or spin-spin interactions that come out when one performs a one-shot SWT. This
implies that such terms are a result of decoupling the non-local interactions of the impurity (it is talking to all the mobile electrons), and cannot be generated when we remove
just the local interactions of the mobile electrons. Instead, if one performs a URG in
which we non-perturbatively kill the 2-point vertices in the SIAM, such 4-point vertices
are generated. This is shown in the next subsection.

4.2.1

Obtaining the Kondo model from the SIAM via a one-shot URG

Here we will show how we can obtain the spin-spin interaction of the Kondo model by
performing a one-shot URG on the SIAM. This should justify that the action of performing
an SWT is analogous to decoupling the whole band via URG.
There are three departures from the conventional way of doing URG (or PMS).
130

Chapter 4. Connection between URG and Other Canonical Transformations
• We will be severing the connections of the impurity with all the mobile electrons
in one-shot, and not iteratively.
• We will have to trivialize the quantum fluctuation operator 𝜔ˆ by replacing it with
the diagonal part of the initial state energy.

To recover the SWT scales from the URG ones, we have to substitute each 𝜔𝑖 by the energy
of the initial state to which it corresponds. From eq. 4.2.38, we note that 𝜔1 refers to the
initial state in which 𝑛ˆ 𝑘𝜎 = 𝑛ˆ 𝑑𝜎 = 1 − 𝑛ˆ 𝑑𝜎 = 1. Therefore, 𝜔1 = 21 𝜖𝑘 + 𝜖𝑑 . Similarly, 𝜔0 refers
to the initial state in which 𝑛ˆ 𝑘𝜎 = 1 − 𝑛ˆ 𝑑𝜎 = 1 − 𝑛ˆ 𝑑𝜎 = 1. Therefore, 𝜔0 = 21 𝜖𝑘 . Substituting
these into the URG energy scales gives back the SWT scales.

This proves that the family of Hamiltonians H (𝑙) satisfy the flow equation eq. 4.3.1. 𝜂(𝑙)

of the exponential in the unitary transformation. In URG, the generator to decouple one

− 𝜂𝑞𝛽 .
In CUT (Continuous Unitary Transformation) RG [31], we progressively block-diagonalize
the Hamiltonian by removing off-diagonal terms that are farthest from the diagonal,
through infinitesimal unitary transformations. The change is described

 as a flow against
the parameter 𝑙. The canonical choice of the generator is 𝜂(𝑙) = H𝑑 , H𝑋 , where H𝑑 is the
diagonal part of the Hamiltonian and H𝑋 = H − H𝑑 is the off-diagonal part of the Hamiltonian. Therefore,

Off-diagonal terms that connect larger energy differences 𝜉 decay the fastest.
CUT RG from URG
We will now see that the renormalization in URG can also be put into a similar form.
From eq. 3.1.47, we can write the URG renormalization in the diagonal part as
i
1h †
(4.3.23)
ΔH 0 =
𝜂 − 𝜂, H
2

where H 0 = H 𝑑 + H 𝑖 . The URG generator can be recast (starting from the definitions of
𝜂, eqs. 3.1.14) as
𝜂 † − 𝜂 = 𝐺 1 𝑐 †𝑇 − 𝐺 0𝑇 † 𝑐

(4.3.24)

In the last step, we changed the second and fourth terms using the constraints 𝐺1 𝑐†𝑇 =
𝑐†𝑇𝐺0 and 𝐺0𝑇 † 𝑐 = 𝑇 † 𝑐𝐺1 , eq. 3.1.16. We now add and subtract 𝐺1 𝐺1−1 𝑐†𝑇 = 𝑐†𝑇 and 𝐺0 𝐺0−1𝑇 † 𝑐 =
𝑇 † 𝑐 for each term.
