Particle-hole symmetry and charge SU(2) invariance

An important distinction between the SIAM charge Kondo and the SIAM spin-Kondo
models is that, unlike the charge Kondo model where we had independent spin-rotation
invariance (obtained by setting 𝐽𝑧 = 𝐽𝑡 ) and impurity particle-hole symmetry (obtained by
setting 𝜖𝑑 = −𝜖𝑑 −𝑈), this model has a composite particle-hole symmetry and SU(2)-charge
symmetry. To see this, consider the impurity part of the model:

𝑐𝑑 𝛽 𝑐 𝑐𝑘𝛽 𝑐𝑘 0 𝛽 + h.c.
(5.3.25)

𝑑𝛽

The charge isospin reversal here corresponds to the transformation 𝑐𝑑 → 𝑐𝑑† and 𝑐𝑘 → 𝑐𝑘† ,
because then 2𝐶𝑑𝑧 = 𝑛ˆ 𝑑 − 1 → 1 − 𝑛ˆ 𝑑 = −2𝐶𝑑𝑧 . But this transformation is just the impurity
particle-hole transformation we encountered earlier. As a result, the total constraint for

For 𝜔 − 2𝑞 + 14 𝐽 + 14 𝐾 > 0, the flow is towards a weak coupling theory, but these are not
URG fixed points. Such flows are shown in fig. 6.2. For the rest of the values of 𝜔, we
get RG flows towards a strong-coupling fixed point, with large value of 𝐽 and 𝐾, fig. 6.3.
For sufficiently small values of 𝐾𝐽 , the flow is towards zero 𝑈. All such flows characterise

a resonant-level strong coupling fixed point, where the four atomic impurity levels are
degenerate and located exactly at the Fermi surface. For larger values of 𝐾𝐽 , there exist
flows towards a large positive 𝑈. Such fixed points energetically favour an impurity
occupation of 1. Both these classes of flows of 𝑈 are depicted in fig. 6.4.

Effect of non-zero 𝑉 on the RG flows

The introduction of 𝑉 into the RG equations make them analytically intractable, and we
have to solve them numerically. The general observation is that we now get both zero
and non-zero values of 𝑈 ∗ in all the phases. The low quantum fluctuation scale behaviour
in the first quadrant is shown in fig. 6.7. It is very similar to that obtained from NRG, as
was shown in fig. 2.5.

6.3. NUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SYMMETRIC MODEL
First quadrant The first quadrant shows the flow from a free orbital fixed point near
𝑉 = 𝑈 = 𝐽 = 0 to an intermediate local moment phase with large 𝑈 with a final crossover
to a stable fixed point at 𝐽 ∗  𝐽0 , 𝑈 ∗ = 0. The initial free orbital fixed point involves four
degenerate impurity states at the impurity, and hence no local moment. The intermediate phase involves a local moment because of the large 𝑈. The final stable phase involves
an impurity which is strongly-coupled to the impurity because of the large 𝑉 and 𝐽. This
crossover is depicted in fig. 6.9.

Figure 6.9: 𝑈 − 𝐽 and 𝑈 − 𝑉 RG flows.
We have also checked that the fixed point values of 𝐽 and 𝑉 go on increasing as we
increase the system size.
Third quadrant In the third quadrant (𝑈0 < 0, 𝐾0 > 𝐽0 ), we see the flow to large negative
value of 𝑈, leading to a large contribution of the holon-doublon sectors of the impurity
subspace, and a large value of 𝐾 ∗ which means that the impurity charge sector couples
very strongly with the bath charge sector. This is essentially the charge analogue of the
Kondo effect; the relevant transformation is
|↑i → | 2i , |↓i → | 0i , 𝐽 → 𝐾, 𝑈 → −𝑈

(6.3.14)

The ground state in this sector will be a charge singlet, as shown in the next section. This
was also reported by Taraphder and Coleman in [37].

6.3.4

Phase diagram for 𝑉 > 0

We can now summarize the various fixed point phases. The physically relevant ones are
the first and third quadrants. The first quadrant features a large spin-exchange coupling
𝐽 and a positive 𝑈 in the bare model, and the stable flows are towards a large 𝐽 ∗ and a
very small (≈ 0) 𝑈 ∗ . The fixed point state will be mostly a spin singlet, in which the impurity polarization gets quenched by the spin-flip scattering of the conduction electrons.

quadrant.

179

6.3. NUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SYMMETRIC MODEL
The third quadrant is the regime of the charge-Kondo effect, and involves a negative 𝑈
at the bare level which physically motivates a large charge-Kondo coupling 𝐾. The fixed
point again involves flow to a large 𝐾 ∗ , but the 𝑈 flows to large negative here, implying
a state where the charge sectors dominate heavily and the ground state is primarily a
charge-singlet in which the destruction or annihilation of the Cooper-pair like states becomes prohibited.
These results are summarized in the table below.

The first term is the kinetic energy of all the electrons. The next two terms are the
impurity-diagonal pieces, featuring the renormalised interaction 𝑈 ∗ . The next three terms
are the residual interactions between the impurity and the metal, with the renormalised
couplings 𝑉 ∗ , 𝐽 ∗ and 𝐾 ∗ . The summations in these terms extend from the fixed point momentum cutoff Λ∗ to 0. This is the region of momentum space which the URG was unable
to decouple. The operators 𝑠® and 𝐶® represent the macroscopic magnetic

The final two terms represent the diagonal pieces of the RG steps that have been completed. These survive because the URG removes only the number-off-diagonal terms;
terms like 𝑆𝑧𝑑 𝑠𝑧 and 𝐶 𝑧𝑑 𝐶 𝑧 conserve the number of particles and hence survive. These will
also be renormalised, and hence the subscript 𝑞 on 𝐽𝑞𝑧 signifies that it is has been renormalised up to a certain momentum.

To make progress with the ground state, we will simplify the effective Hamiltonian by

like a Fermion: 𝑛ˆ 22𝜎 = 𝑛ˆ 2𝜎 . For our two-site problem, we will imagine this to be the annihilation operator for the site 2, for the spin sigma. The corresponding operator for the
first site is of course just the impurity electron annihilation operator:

electron on site 1 and a down electron on site 2. This Hamiltonian conserves the total
number operator 𝑛ˆ ≡ 𝑛ˆ 1 + 𝑛ˆ 2 , so we can analyse the various subspaces corresponding to
particular values of 𝑛ˆ separately.
We will adopt the following notation to represent the states in this Hilbert space. A general state will be represented in the Fock space basis as |𝑛1↑ 𝑛1↓ 𝑛2↑ 𝑛2↓i. For example,

First lets get the trivial cases of 𝑛ˆ = 0, 4 out of the way. The only possible states are
| 0000i and | 1111i respectively. Both these states are eigenstates because the first one has
no electron to scatter, and the second one has no vacant state to scatter into. These states
have energy eigenvalues 14 𝑘
The subspaces 𝑛ˆ = 1, 3 are each four-dimensional. More precisely speaking, the 𝑛ˆ = 1
subspace can have the following basis
(6.4.20)

|↑, 0i , | 0, ↑i , |↓, 0i , | 0, ↓i

However, since the Hamiltonian conserves the total spin (both magnetic and charge), we
can divide this Hilbert subspace into two smaller subspaces which do not talk to each
other - one having the states |↑, 0i , | 0, ↑i and hence a total spin magnetization of + 12 , and
the other having the remaining states and a total spin magnetization of − 12 . The action

The 𝑛ˆ = 3 subspace is very similar. We can obtain the basis directly from the 𝑛ˆ = 1
case by substituting the holes with doubles:

Since a double impurity has the same energy as a vacant impurity (because of p-h symmetry, both are zero), the diagonal part corresponding to the first site will not change.
We can then write down the eigenstates and eigenvalues directly from those of 𝑛ˆ = 1,
simply by making the transformation | 0i → |↑↓i.

The full list of eigenstates is
Although 𝐸−2 is the ground state of this two-dimensional subspace, we haven’t yet checked
what is the true ground state of the full Hilbert space. The eigenstates eq. 6.4.28 through
6.4.30 are obviously higher than 𝐸−2 , because of the presence of the singlet − 43 𝑗 and the
negative 𝛾 contribution in 𝐸−2 compared to the positive triplet contribution 41 𝑗 in those
equations. The only other competitors are the one in eq. 6.4.31 which we call 𝐸 2𝑐 , and the
low energy eigenstate in eq. 6.4.23, which we call 𝐸−1 . We first shown that 𝐸−1 > 𝐸−2 . The
difference between 𝐸−2 and 𝐸−1 is

Because of the presence of the large 𝑣 in the first quadrant, this will necessarily be negative there. So, the true ground state in the first quadrant is 𝐸−2 . In the third quadrant, the
large value of 𝑘 will make the difference positive and the true ground state will be the
charge singlet.
These conclusions have been checked numerically and shown in fig. 6.15, where we have
plotted the sign of Δ𝐸 𝑔 as a function of 𝐾0 − 𝐽0 . For positive values of 𝐾0 − 𝐽0 , we are in
the third quadrant, and the sign of Δ𝐸 𝑔 being +1 implies that 𝐸−2 > 𝐸 2𝑐 , and so the third
quadrant ground state is the charge singlet (𝐸 2𝑐 ). On the other hand, as 𝐾0 − 𝐽0 becomes
negative, we move into the first quadrant, and the sign of Δ𝐸 𝑔 also flips, implying that we
