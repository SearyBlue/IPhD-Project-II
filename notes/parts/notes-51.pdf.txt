Poor man’s scaling

The idea is to reduce the bandwidth from 𝐷 to 𝐷 − 𝛿𝐷, by considering all possible excitations in that range, up to second order. The transition matrix second order contributions
in that range
(2.4.112)
𝑇 (2) = 𝑉𝐺0𝑉
can be clubbed into a term Δ𝑉 . This term is a representative of the scatterings from that
range. After reducing the bandwidth to 𝐷 − 𝛿𝐷, the effect of the excluded region can be
incorporated by changing the interaction term 𝑉 → 𝑉 0 = 𝑉 + Δ𝑉 . The interaction part is

Incorporating Δ𝑉 will involve changing the coupling constants 𝐽𝑧 and 𝐽𝑇 . There are three
types of scattering processes at second order:
 2
1. No spin-flip of impurity - involving 𝑆𝑑𝑧
2. one spin-flip of impurity - involving 𝑆𝑑𝑧 𝑆𝑑± or 𝑆𝑑± 𝑆𝑑𝑧
3. two spin-flips of impurity - involving 𝑆𝑑± 𝑆𝑑∓
The first kind does not involve any spin impurity operator (𝑆𝑧2 = 41 ), so it will be ignored. The second kind will leave the impurity spin flipped at the end, and will hence
result in a renormalization of 𝐽𝑇 . The third kind will leave the impurity spin unchanged
(two flips), and hence will involve a renormalization of 𝐽𝑧 .

Two more processes can be constructed from the above two processes, by switching the
𝑆𝑑+ and 𝑆𝑑𝑧 operations. The change in the first process is that the 𝑆𝑑𝑧 term will now become
+𝑆𝑑𝑧 𝑐𝑘† 0↑ 𝑐𝑞↑

(2.4.139)

so that will invert the sign. The change in the second process is that now the 𝑞-electron
has to start off as ↓, which means that the 𝑆𝑑𝑧 term for this process becomes
−𝑆𝑑𝑧 𝑐𝑘† 0↓ 𝑐𝑞↓

(2.4.140)

So the sign of the second process will also invert. The change common to both the process
𝑆+
is that 𝑆𝑑𝑧 𝑆𝑑+ becomes 𝑆𝑑+ 𝑆𝑑𝑧 . Since 𝑆𝑑+ 𝑆𝑑𝑧 = − 2𝑑 , this will involve a second change in sign for
both processes. Thus, overall there is no change for either proces.

(2.4.149)

The first equation says that as the cutoff decreases, 𝑔1 will always increase. For 𝑔 < 0
(ferromagnetic coupling), the coupling will go to zero. That is, at sufficiently low temperatures, the impurity electron becomes effectively decoupled from the conduction band.
The phenomenon is called asymptotic freedom. For the antiferromagnetic case, the coupling should go to infinity. This means that at sufficiently low temperatures, the coupling
will necessarily become appreciable large so as to render perturbation theory inapplicable. Dividing the two coupling equations gives
d 𝑔1
d 𝑔2

=

𝑔2
=⇒ 𝑔12 − 𝑔22 = constant
𝑔1

(2.4.150)

Taking 𝑔1 as the x-axis and 𝑔2 as the y-axis, depending on the sign of the constant, the
solution is a vertical hyperbola or horizontal hyperbola. Since the coupling equations
are unchanged under the transformation 𝑔2 → −𝑔2 , analyzing the upper half (𝑔2 > 0) suffices. The antiferromagnetic case is easy. 𝑔1 > 0 means 𝑔1 will always increase the RG
flow. The only solution is that both 𝑔1 and 𝑔2 flow to infinity. For the ferromagnetic case,
if |𝑔1 | > 𝑔2 , 𝑔1 will increase and the representative point will reach the x-axis (𝑔2 = 0). At
this point, both the couplings will stop changing because both the derivatives involve 𝑔2 .
So the fixed point in this case is 𝑔2 = 0 and 𝑔1 is some negative value. However, if |𝑔1 | < 𝑔2 ,
the representative point will reach the positive y-axis. Since 𝑔2 ≠ 0 here, 𝑔1 will continue
to grow and become positive at some point. From there, it becomes the antiferromagnetic case.

for 𝑔 𝐷0 shows that perturbation theory will work only for 𝑇  𝑇𝐾 , because close to 𝑇𝐾 , the

As we lower the temperature, the quantum processes are able to be coherent and lower

Since the interaction term is spherically symmetric, it suffices to consider a one dimensional chain of conduction electrons with the impurity site coupling to the conduction
electron at the origin. This electron forms a singlet with the impurity electron,
| 0↑, 𝑑 ↓i − | 0↓, 𝑑↑i
√
2

(2.4.198)

Considering a tight-binding model, the only electron that can hop to the zeroth site is the
one on the first site. The hopping of this electron on to the zeroth site would lead to an
energy of
3

2

𝐸1 = − 𝐽 + 𝐽 = 0

(2.4.199)

because the new electron would have the spin opposite to the other electron on the 0th
site. This means that breaking the singlet raises the energy by 32 𝐽. At low temperatures
and very large 𝐽, this is not possible. That being said, there can always be virtual fluctuations into excited states. For example, the impurity electron can tunnel into the conduction band (𝑛𝑑 = 0) or another conduction electron may scatter into the impurity site
(𝑛𝑑 = 2). Both these states have zero energy. With further virtual excitations, it is also
possible to go into the triplet state with energy 2𝐽 . What this means is that although the
singlet is stable with respect to energy-conserving transitions, the singlet is virtually polarizable, with the help of the site 1 electron. This induces an interaction on the site
1. Since the interaction on the site 1 is just a manifestation of the polarizability of the
singlet, we can either take the singlet with its polarizability and assume the conduction
band to be non-interacting, or we can assume the singlet to be static and take the Fermi
sea to have a localised interaction at the site 1. In the latter picture, we have a frozen
singlet (which can be ignored) and an interacting Fermi sea.
The goal [8] is to calculate the change in phase shift suffered by the conduction electrons
in the presence of interactions. In the absence of interactions, the scattered wavefunction is

Since the singlet is isolated from the Fermi liquid, any change in the chemical potential
will not affect the average occupation of the impurity site h𝑛𝑑 i, and since we know that
h𝑛𝑑 i = 2𝛿(𝜋0) , this means that 𝛿( 0), the phase shift at the Fermi surface, is invariant under a
change of the chemical potential. This in turn means that the resonance scattering (𝛿 = 𝜋2 )
will always be pinned to the Fermi surface. With this knowledge, let us explicitly try to

This shows that the interaction term Φ is responsible for pinning the resonance at the
Fermi level; without that term in the formalism, the occupancy of the impurity site will
change. This is similar to the fact that the interaction term 𝑓 (𝑘, 𝑘0) in the bulk Fermi liquid
is responsible for making the Landau theory invariant under Galilean transformations.

Numerical renormalization group calculation

Wilson’s idea [19] was to remove the limitations of the perturbative nature of Anderson’s
scaling method. To that end, we transformed the Hamiltonian into a one-dimensional
chain, and then iteratively diagonalised chains of increasing length. The Hamiltonian

that the exchange interaction 𝐽 (𝑘, 𝑘0 is independent of spin. To form the linear chain,
we construct a new basis in which to express the conduction electron part 𝐻𝑐 , out of
the states | 0i , 𝐻𝑐 | 0i , 𝐻𝑐2 | 0i , .... | 0i is the origin site, where the impurity resides. The first
member of the new basis is | 0i. The next member is taken to be some state in the subspace
of | 0i and 𝐻𝑐 | 0i,

| 1i = 𝜆 1 𝐻𝑐 | 0i + 𝜆 2 | 0i
(2.5.2)
This is a general form for any ket in the subspace spanned by | 0i and 𝐻𝑐 | 0i. Since we
want the state to be normalised , we can shift one of the parameters to the denominator:
| 1i =

where 𝛾0 sets h1 | 1i = 1. The remaining parameter is set by requiring h1 | 0i = 0. That gives

Therefore,

The diagonalization of these chains become impossible for 𝑛 > 8. To remedy this problem, Wilson, after diagonalization a chain of a particular length, retained only the lowest
parts of the spectrum, and the Hamiltonian for the next stage was formed out of these
low-lying states. This keeps the size of the Hilber space (and hence the matrices) manageable. Another problem is that as one goes on adding sites to the chain, the couplings
need to die off, otherwise this process will never converge.

𝑁−1
index 𝑁. Looking at eq. 2.5.23, the lowest energy scale is Γ𝑁 = 𝐷0 Λ− 2 . Hence, the rescaled
Hamiltonian is

In the series of Hamiltonians {𝐻𝑁 }, the couplings to the extra site are all same, so the
lowest energy scales are all of the same order. This allows us to construct a flow of the
Hamiltonians. The real Hamiltonian is the unscaled one, so it is given by

This is the same equation as eq. 2.5.26, with 𝐻 𝑁 expressed in its eigenbasis and the creation and annihilation operators also expressed in that basis; the 𝐶(𝑚, 𝑚0) are just the
matrix elements of 𝑐 and 𝑐† in that basis.
To check whether the guesses about the fixed points are true, Wilson did the following. He set 𝐽 = 0.009 and then then calculated the lowest excitations of the Hamiltonians
obtained from the NRG in the limit of large 𝑁. They indeed correspond to the excitations
of the Kondo hamiltonian at 𝐽 = ∞, meaning that under the application of the NRG, the
𝐽 = 0.009 Hamiltonian flowed to the fixed-point Hamiltonian 𝐽 = ∞.

Correspondence between the Kondo model fixed-point

The parameters 𝜖𝑘 , 𝑉𝑘 , 𝑈 are not the same as the Anderson model we start with, but I am
using the same symbols for convenience. The interaction term 𝑈 is the leading irrelevant
operator near the low-energy fixed point. For 𝑇 → 0, assuming only single excitations,
the interacting term will not get invoked.

where 𝑁 is the number of sites. Note that the number of excitations, h𝑛𝑞 i has to be defined
differently for the states above and below the Fermi surface. For excited states above 𝜖𝐹 ,
the number of excitations is given usually:

where 𝑛𝑘 stands for the number of particles. For states below 𝜖𝐹 , however, we need to
count the number of holes:

This is analogous to the Landau quasiparticle energy functional, eq. 2.2.19, 𝑈 acting as

the quasiparticle distribution 𝛿𝑛𝑘𝜎 and hence the quasiparticle energies 𝜖𝑘𝜎 . This leads
to a complicated feedback effect. However, at low temperatures, higher order excitations will be very low and we can approximate by considering only the variation in the
