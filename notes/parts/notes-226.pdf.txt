Calculation of Wilson ratio from effective local Fermi
liquid

In this section, we will calculate the zero temperature Wilson ratio of the impurity in the
Kondo regime of the SIAM. Since this is a low energy property, our starting point will be
the fixed point Hamiltonian of eq. 6.4.3, after substituting 𝑈 ∗ = 𝐾 ∗ = 0 (because we are in
the first quadrant):

We know that the ground state for the interacting part is predominantly the spin-singlet
(it was shown while calculating the ground states of the effective zero-mode Hamiltonian
that the ground state is a mixture of singlet and triplet, and the triplet part dies out at
large system sizes, see eq. 6.4.40), so we will take that as our reference state and treat the
hopping part that connects the origin to the first site,

as a weak perturbation. 𝑟®1 here sums over the sites that are nearest to the origin. Once
that is taken care of, we will have a decoupled singlet formed by the impurity and the zeroth site, and the rest of the lattice formed by 𝑁 −1 sites along with the interaction induced
by the perturbation. The goal here is to see whether the effect of the perturbation is to
lower the energy of the singly-occupied state | 𝑛ˆ 1 = 1i compared to the doubly-occupied
state | 𝑛ˆ 1 = 2i or to raise it. If the perturbation shifts the energy of the singly-occupied
state below the doubly-occupied state, then we can conclude that the effect of the perturbation is to raise the energy of the doubly-occupied state, which can then be modeled
by a repulsive term |𝑈 | 𝑛ˆ 1↑ 𝑛ˆ 1↓. If, on the other hand, the effect is to raise the energy of the
singly-occupied state with respect to the 𝑛ˆ 1 = 2 state, then that effect is equivalent to an
attractive term −|𝑈 | 𝑛ˆ 1↑ 𝑛ˆ 1↓.
To be precise, we will compare the energy shifts corresponding to the two states

In the singlet part, the first entry is the configuration of the zeroth site while the second
entry is the configuration of the impurity site. Choosing the ↑ configuration for the site
1 is not a problem because both the non-perturbative and the perturbative interactions
are SU(2)-symmetric. To demonstrate this, note that all energy shifts will depend on
the unperturbed states |𝜙 (0) i in two ways: through the energies in the denominator and
through the matrix element in the numerator. The unperturbed energy goes not depend
on the configuration of the 𝑟®1 site, because the energy is dominated by the singlet. The
matrix element is also independent of the sigma:

The first order correction will be zero as we will see shortly, but the short version is that
𝑉 |𝜙 (0) i is obviously orthogonal to |𝜙 (0) i. All higher energy shifts can be represented as
where 𝑋, for example, is

This proves that the shift is independent of 𝜎. The reason we could shift the bra h𝜎| across
the 𝑋 without any sign change is that 𝑋 will have even number of operators in product,
because it operates on 0 and 1.

The upshot of all this is that the second order shift will be same for both the single and
doubly-occupied states, so we will ignore that correction as it can be absorbed into the
zero-point energy.
The third order correction is given by

(7.8.16)

This correction can also be argued to be zero, as follows. The second term is of course
trivially zero because 𝐸𝜙(1) itself is 0. For the first term, note that |𝑖 (0) i must have 𝑛ˆ 0 = 0, 2
in order to give non-zero inner product with 𝑉 |𝜙 (0) i. If we continue this, 𝑉 |𝑖 (0) i will have
𝑛ˆ 0 = 1, so | 𝑗 (0) i must also have the same. Then, 𝑉 | 𝑗 (0) i will have 𝑛ˆ 0 = 0, 2 and hence the
215

7.8. CALCULATION OF WILSON RATIO FROM EFFECTIVE LOCAL FERMI LIQUID
inner product h𝜙 (0) | 𝑉 | 𝑗 (0) i will be 0. The third order corrections for both the single and
doubly occupied states are thus 0.
We move on to the fourth order correction. The general formula is quite formidable,
so we only write down the terms that aren’t outright zero for this problem:

The mean-field approximation then involves dropping the first term which is a quadratic

Det𝐺 −1 (𝐶) Det 𝐺
Since 𝑛Det 𝐺−1 (𝐶) counts the number of times the curve Det 𝐺 −1 (𝐶) winds around the origin,
it is integer-valued and topological. Seki and Yunoki also show that the this number is
given by
𝑛Det 𝐺−1 (𝐶) = 𝑃Det 𝐺 (𝐶) − 𝑍Det 𝐺 (𝐶)
(7.9.21)

where 𝑃 𝑓 (𝑧) (𝐶) is the number of poles of 𝑓 (𝑧) enclosed by the contour 𝐶, and 𝑍 is the corresponding number of zeros. The total number of particles in the resonant level model
can thus be written as
i
1h
𝑁 = 𝑃Det 𝐺𝑑 (Γ< ) − 𝑍Det 𝐺𝑑 (Γ< ) +
𝑃Det 𝐺𝑑 (Γ0 ) − 𝑍Det 𝐺𝑑 (Γ0 )

The average number of particles can thus be expressed purely in terms of the number of
poles and zeros of the impurity and the conduction electron Green’s functions. As shown
by Seki and Yunoki, the second line gives the Luttinger volume 𝑉𝐿 :
𝑁 = 𝑃Det 𝐺𝑑 (Γ< ) − 𝑍Det 𝐺𝑑 (Γ< ) +

If we start from a non-interacting model (𝑉𝑘 = 0), we can write

𝑁 = N𝑖𝑚𝑝
+ 𝑉𝐿0

223

(7.9.24)

7.9. LUTTINGER’S AND FRIEDEL’S SUM RULES

where N𝑖𝑚𝑝
is simply the number of singularities of 𝐺𝑑 on the real axis, for the noninteracting case. We now turn up the interaction 𝑉𝑘 , keeping the total number of particles
conserved at 𝑁. With a non-zero 𝑉𝑘 , the impurity self-energy can be written (assuming a
constant density of states) as
(7.9.25)
Σ𝑑 (𝑧) = Σ𝑑real (𝑧) − 𝑖Δ

so that the impurity Greens function becomes
𝐺𝑑 (𝑧) =

1

𝑧 − 𝜖𝑑 − Σ𝑑real (𝑧) + 𝑖Δ

(7.9.26)

We can see that the presence of an imaginary part lifts the pole of 𝐺𝑑 (𝑧) off the real axis,
and since the contour Γ0 encloses only the real axis, this will count as a loss in the number
of poles of 𝐺𝑑 (𝑧). Also, if we specialize to the case where the renormalized impurity site
energy 𝜖∗𝑑 = 𝜖𝑑 + Σ𝑑real = 0, this loss will happen at the Fermi surface, and will hence be
multiplied by a factor of half. We can therefore write
0

If we take into account the spin-degeneracy and redefine 𝑉𝐿 to mean the Luttinger volume for both momentum and spin degrees of freedom, we get
𝑉𝐿 = 𝑉𝐿0 + 1

(7.9.28)

This is a specific case of the more general result for Kondo lattices obtained by Oshikawa

224

Chapter 7. Results and Features of the Low-Energy Theory
using flux-insertion arguments in [40]. One can now ask what happens to this result once
we also incorporate the spin-exchange interaction 𝐽 𝑆®𝑑 · 𝑠®; we can expect that it will complicate the self-energy of the impurity. It cannot, however, preclude the loss of the real pole,
nor can it create a new singularity - to do so would require the self-energy to diverge, and
we are working with finite systems here. This suggests that the eq. 7.9.28 would still hold.
We have also not accounted for the RG flow from the local moment fixed point to the
strong-coupling fixed point. The local moment fixed point is characterized by a decoupled quantum top:
HLM = 𝜖𝑑 𝑛ˆ 𝑑 + 𝑈 𝑛ˆ 𝑑↑ 𝑛ˆ 𝑑↓
(7.9.29)
It can be shown that the single-particle Green’s function for this effective Hamiltonian
is similar to the one at the free-orbital fixed point. We will use the equation of motion
technique to solve for the Green’s function. The time-domain retarded Green’s function
is defined as

Reverse RG analysis

The goal here is to chart the journey starting from the IR fixed point towards the UV
regime, by following one particular wavefunction. We will start with a very simple IR
ground state wavefunction, and then go back towards the UV ground state by applying
the inverse unitary operator 𝑈 † :
𝑈 : | 1, 2, ..., 𝑁i → | 1, 2, ..., 𝑁 − 1i |𝑁i → ... → | 1, 2, ..., 𝑁 ∗ i |𝑁 ∗ + 1i ... |𝑁i

UV ground state

The first process is the forward RG which we used to obtain the scaling equations. The
second process is the reverse RG which we wil undertake now. The IR ground state we
will start with will consist of four momenta states, 𝑘−2,−1,1,2 . 𝑘1,2 will be the states above the
Fermi surface while 𝑘−1,−2 will be the ones below it. The algorithm of reverse RG is shown
in fig. 7.11.
For the purpose of illustrating how we will construct the many-body ground state
however, we will work with just two momenta states instead of four, one above and one
below.

purity, while the ones inside have been decoupled. The next step of reverse RG involves
applying the inverse transformation on the Hamiltonian, which will couple two more
electrons from the IOMS (hence four dark green circles in the second step), leading to
an enlargement of the emergent window. The unitary varies for each step, hence the
notation 𝑈 𝑗 .

Figure 7.12: Increase in the number of coupled elements under reverse RG. We start with
the impurity coupled with two electrons, which increases at each step of the reverse RG.
The weight of the bonds changes at each step, and is described by the running couplings
𝑉 𝑗 , 𝐽 𝑗 , 𝐾 𝑗 . The onsite energy of the impurity itself also varies at each step, which is essentially the renormalization in 𝜖𝑑 and 𝑈.

The results of the reverse RG study are depicted in the following plots. We have used
two types of quantities in the process - mutual information and correlation functions.
The mutual information between two subsystems 𝐴 and 𝐵 in a wavefunction with many
subsystems is defined as
𝐼 (𝐴 : 𝐵) = 𝑆 𝐴 + 𝑆𝐵 − 𝑆 𝐴𝐵
(7.10.24)
where 𝑆𝑖 𝑗..𝑞 is the von-Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix obtained after
tracing out all degrees of freedom except those in the subscript of 𝑆.

The mutual information between two electrons inside the entangled cloud increases as
we go towards the IR fixed point. This can be understood in the following manner; as the
wavefunction flows towards a smaller sized emergent cloud, the entanglement between
those electrons gets distilled out.

We have also computed some correlation functions. All Dof themE increase towards the
IR fixed point. The increase in the correlation function 𝑛ˆ 𝑘1↑ 𝑛ˆ 𝑘2↓ arises from the crystallization

for the Kondo cloud.

Conclusions and Future Directions
In this work, we have seen that the fate of the SIAM at low temperatures is a growth
in the spin, charge and hybridisation couplings 𝐽, 𝐾 and 𝑉 . This confirms the NRG and
Bethe ansatz result that the low energy behavior is that of a screened impurity. We
stress that the spin or the charge exchange coupling, 𝐽 or 𝐾, is necessary to screen the
corresponding degree of freedom on the impurity. The ground state wavefunction for
the low energy theory is primarily a spin-singlet with some charge-triplet content in the
spin-Kondo regime. In the charge-Kondo regime, we find a charge-singlet instead. The
susceptibility is seen to increase as we go to lower temperatures, signaling increased
spin-flip scattering and providing a justification for the increase in resistivity after the
Kondo temperature 𝑇𝐾 . At high temperatures the susceptibility saturates to 81 , mimicking
a four-fold degenerate object because at high temperatures, the impurity energy scales
become blurred.
We also obtain a Hamiltonian for the Kondo cloud (the set of electrons which screen
the impurity) - it has a Fermi liquid number diagonal term as well as an off-diagonal
non-Fermi liquid piece. It is this off-diagonal piece that is responsible for the strong
entanglement between the impurity and the conduction electrons. This contribution is
found to increase as we move towards the infrared fixed point. Higher order scattering
processes will give more complicated terms in the effective Hamiltonian. We also calculate information-theoretic quantities like mutual information between impurity and
conduction electrons. They show that the conduction electrons become more stronglyentangled as we move towards the infrared fixed point. They also reveal an increase
in off-diagonal correlations between conduction electrons which is indicative of an increase in the off-diagonal scattering content in the effective Hamiltonian of the Kondo
cloud. We also find the value of the zero-temperature Wilson ratio to be 2 in the Kondo
regime. Closely related to this is the result that the Luttinger’s volume at the fixed point
accommodates the impurity site into the Fermi volume such that Luttinger’s count increases by 1 compared to the value at the free-orbital or local moment fixed points. The
renormalization of the impurity spectral across the RG shows the emergence of the central resonance at the strong-coupling fixed point.
This work still leaves some problems untouched. Some new questions and interesting
235

prospects have also emerged. We discuss them now.
• Can we obtain an analytical expression for the finite temperature Wilson ratio? The
zero temperature value was obtained using low temperature approximations, so a
finite temperature calculation would need to be non-perturbative. In other words,
the full effect of the conduction bath will most probably come into play.
• The spectral function of the impurity is another interesting quantity to explore.
It is not yet completely certain which parts of the effective Hamiltonian for the
cloud lead to which features of the spectral function. It would be interesting to
check whether the Fermi liquid part gives the central peak and the non-Fermi liquid
the side humps, or something else altogether. We also intend to explore the bath
spectral function and its variation under the RG.
• In Chapter 4, we find that the URG renormalization in Hamiltonian has a form similar to that of URG - a generalized double-bracket form. This suggests that URG
might have uses in linear algebra as well. It is well-known that transformations of
the double-bracket form are unitary and can be used in minimization and sorting
problems [10]. It has also been shown that the unitary flows correspond to motion
along a geodesic if a suitable manifold is defined. This suggests that we can look for
a quantity which is minimized by URG in the journey towards the fixed point and
see if it can be used to provide a faster and more robust algorithm for optimization
problems.
• One can also look into the lattice versions of these models - the Kondo lattice and
the Anderson lattice problems which involve two interacting bands - one for the
impurity and the other for the conduction electrons [41]. Since there is a macroscopic number of impurity electrons, such a model shows phase transitions. One
big project for the future can be to look into such models, map the phase diagram
and search for superconducting phases or non-Fermi liquid phases.
• We have seen that the zero-mode of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian is essentially a two-site Anderson model(a.k.a Anderson dimer), which can be solved
exactly. An interesting endeavor in this context could be to see if there is a unitary transformation that converts the Anderson dimer to a two-site Hubbard model
(Hubbard dimer). The point of this exercise would be to shed some light on the inner workings of DMFT. The imposition of the self-consistency requirement in DMFT
introduces a translational invariance into the Anderson model and converts it into
the Hubbard model. If we could figure out a transformation that does the same (albeit, between dimers and not the full-fledged models), it might lead to new insights
into DMFT). This might allows us to see a metal-insulator phase transition, specially
because of the impurity spectral function morphing that we saw from the effective
Hamiltonian, shown again in fig. 8.1.
• It is known from DMFT calculations that the spectral function of the bath changes
under a change of 𝑈, leading to a metal-insulator transition. An interesting project
could be to redo the URG of the SIAM with more complicated baths (by inserting

non-trivial self-energies into the bath), and see if the phase-diagram changes. As
it stands now, there is no provision for a phase transition in the SIAM because
there is only one stable phase. If the inclusion of a non-trivial bath brings about
a phase-transition in the impurity phase diagram, that is essentially a mirror of the
phase transition happening in the Hubbard model. The importance of this potential discovery is that the self-energies that we wish to insert into the bath have been
obtained from a URG treatment of the Hubbard model, and the appearance of the
phase transition would then show that URG can be used to do much of the work
that DMFT does, and it provides an avenue of improving/remodeling DMFT.
