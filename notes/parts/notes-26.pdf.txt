Landau’s theory of Fermi liquids

Since we will be using some results and concepts of Fermi liquids, its best to discuss the
relevant details briefly. This section is adapted from ref. [13].
A ideal Fermi gas is a collection of non-interacting Fermions. Since they are non-interacting,
the eigenstates of the complete system are just the collections of the eigenstates of the
particles and holes. The eigenstate will be of the form {𝑛𝑘1↑, 𝑛𝑘1↓, 𝑛𝑘2↑, 𝑛𝑘2↓, 𝑛𝑘3↑, 𝑛𝑘3↓, ..., },
where 𝑛𝑘𝜎 ∈ {0, 1} is the number of particles with momentum 𝑘 and spin 𝜎. In the ground
state,

 1 𝑘 ≤ 𝑘𝐹

𝑛𝑘𝜎 =

Chapter 2. Preliminaries and Existing Results
Excitations involve adding an electron above 𝑘𝐹 or deleting an electron below 𝑘𝐹 . The
former is called a particle while the latter is called a hole. A general excited state of the
total system is a collection of particle and hole excitations.
We next consider interacting systems, but very specific ones. That is, we consider interacting systems whose excitations can be mapped one-to-one with the excitations of the
ideal system, provided the interactions are turned on sufficiently slowly. Alternatively,
there exists a sufficiently slow rate of turning off the interactions such that any interacting excited state Ψ∗ continuously flows into some excited state Φ of the ideal system as
the interactions flow to 0.

turn interactions off

If some state Γ∗ , instead of flowing into an ideal excited state, gets lost while the interactions are being turned off, then we are not considering that system. All excited states
must flow into some ideal state and vice-versa. This means that the interacting excited
states can be labeled by the same good quantum numbers 𝑘® and 𝜎.That is, if some eigenstate of the interacting system flows into the ideal eigenstate {𝑛𝑘𝜎 }, we can just as well
use the distribution {𝑛𝑘𝜎 } to label the interacting eigenstate. The particle and hole excitations of the ideal system might flow into some very complicated state of the interacting
system, which we call a quasiparticle/quasihole. In other words, a system (ideal ground
state + particle of momentum 𝑘) goes to (interacting ground state + quasiparticle of momentum 𝑘). If an interacting eigenstate corresponds to the state {𝑛𝑘𝜎 }, then {𝑛𝑘𝜎 } is said
to be the quasiparticle distribution function for that interacting state. Just as we denote
eigenstates of the total ideal system using the collection of particles and holes, similarly
we use the quasiparticle and quasiholes to describe eigenstates of the interacting system.
Let 𝑘+ > 𝑘𝐹 and 𝑘− < 𝑘𝐹 . Then,
turn interactions on

|𝐼𝐺𝑆i ⊗ |𝑘+ i −−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−→ |𝑅𝐺𝑆i ⊗ |𝑘+ i ∗

|i ∗ denotes a quasi-ket. ”IGS” and ”RGS” are ideal and real(interacting) ground states.

depend on whether other quasiparticles are present; there might be interactions among

The single-impurity Anderson model (SIAM)

The SIAM consists of a single localized impurity site talking to a conduction bath. The
impurity site has an energy 𝜖𝑑 which is typically below the Fermi surface and hence
favours a bound state. We will assume the impurities are from a d or f-electron such
that the orbitals are localized and there is a local repulsion 𝑈 produced by the localized
orbitals.

hybridisation. So, d-site is either up or down, hence magnetic.

• 𝑈  Δ  𝜖𝑑 : Double occupation is still not possible, but now hybridisation will allows the up and down spins to fluctuate on the d-site, leading to zero average magnetization.
• Δ  𝑈  𝜖𝑑 : Hybridisation now fluctuates the up and down spins , leading to zero
average magnetization.
To get a feel for the dynamic of the model, we can consider the very simple atomic limit
(𝑉 = 0).
𝐻atomic = 𝐸𝑑 + 𝐸𝐶𝐵 + 𝑈𝑛𝑑↑ 𝑛𝑑↓
(2.3.2)
Since we are not interested in the Fermi sea and since there is no interaction between
that and the impurity, we can choose to look only at the impurity:
𝐻atomic = 𝜖𝑑 𝑛𝑑 + 𝑈𝑛𝑑↑ 𝑛𝑑↓

(2.3.3)

For a magnetic solution, we need
(𝜖↑ = 𝜖↓ =)𝜖𝑑 < (𝜖0 , 𝜖↑↓) 0, 2𝜖𝑑 + 𝑈

Assuming 𝜖𝑑 = −|𝜖𝑑 |, this is equivalent to

𝐸 − 𝜖𝑑

In the presence of the coupling with the conduction band, there are several ways of creating an excitation at the impurity site, with an energy 𝐸. The first is the bare Green’s
function. This is the situation when the impurity site electron has not scattered. Next is
the case that there is an excitation with energy E (𝐺𝑑0 (𝐸)) followed by a scattering to the
conduction band at some momentum 𝑘. The probability of the scattering is 𝑡. The Greens
1
function for creating the electron 𝑘 is 𝐺𝑘0 = 𝐸−𝜖

𝑘
back to the impurity site is 𝑡, with the Greens function for this final excitation being 𝐺𝑑0 .

The first density of states is delta function, because 𝜖𝑑 is an eigenstate in that case, and
the poles of the corresponding Green’s function are real poles. But the presence of the
hybridisation means that is no longer the case in the second density of states, so the delta
function fades into a Lorentzian in that case, and the poles of the Greens function move
off the real axis.

At this voltage, the two levels have the same energy and double occupancy becomes possible. Electrons can flow from the source to the sink via double occupation on the dot.
For a non-interacting resonance, the conductance can be calculated as follows. The con2

2.3.3

Some conclusions and observations

• The mean field solution predicts that local moments are sustained in the limit of
large 𝑈 and small |𝜖𝑑 |. However, this treatment becomes faulty at low temperatures.
• At low temperatures, the resistivity is found to reach a minimum and then vary
as ln 𝑇 . This behavior stops at some very low temperature 𝑇𝐾 . The temperature 𝑇𝐾
is also that at which the magnetization vanishes, and the susceptibility becomes
constant, suggesting that the impurity spin has condensed into a singlet.

• Since the disappearance of the ln 𝑇 behavior is coincident with the condensation of
the spin degree of freedom, it is natural to hope that the resistivity minimum is a
result of the interaction between the impurity and the conduction spins.
• To describe such an interaction, the way to proceed is to strip the model of the
charge excitations (via a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation). The resultant Hamiltonian consists of an anti-ferromagnetic interaction between the itinerant spins and
the impurity spin, and is called the Kondo model.
23

2.4. THE KONDO MODEL
• Calculating the scattering rate up to second order using the Kondo model produces
a logarithmic term, which explains the log-dependence. Since this perturbative
treatment will fail at small temperatures (where the log term diverges), we need
some other technique to find out the fate of the model at low temperatures.
• Anderson’s poor man’s scaling wraps the effects of high energy scatterings into the
low energy model, showing that the anti-ferromagnetic coupling diverges at low
temperatures, producing a singlet.
• There are two routes that one can follow to note the changes in the system; one
is by reducing the temperature which is equivalent to folding in the high energy
fluctuations, aka scaling. The other is to reduce the onsite interaction 𝑈 and note
the changes in state.
• Reducing the temperature or performing the RG takes the model from the Anderson model (𝑇 > 0) to the Fermi liquid state (𝑇 ∼ 𝑇𝐾 ). This Fermi liquid may have
interactions, depending on the value of 𝑈 we are working in.
• Coming down to 𝑇 < 𝑇𝐾 , we can now modify the 𝑈 from ∞ to 0. Large 𝑈 means the
Fermi liquid has large interactions. Reducing 𝑈 means coming down to a Fermi
gas. For 𝑇 ≠ 0, reducing 𝑈 means going from local moment regime to non-magnetic
regime. For 𝑇 = 0, local moments persist for all 𝑈 > 0.
• It will be seen that in the large 𝑈 regime, the singlet channel scattering phase shift
(phase shift incurred when one singlet state scatters into another singlet state) at
the Fermi energy is ∝ tan−1 𝐽eff . This effective coupling 𝐽eff flows to ∞ under poor
man’s scaling as 𝑇 → 0. Thus, the singlet phase shift at 𝜖𝐹 approaches 𝜋2 as 𝑇 → 0.

2.4

The Kondo model

To study the interactions of the spin degrees of freedom, it becomes necessary to integrate out the charge degrees of freedom from the general scattering term 𝑉 𝑐𝑘† 𝑐𝑑 + h.c..
Doing so produces a simpler Hamiltonian that has the charge fluctuations projected out
and only spin fluctuations remaining.

Derivation of the Kondo Hamiltonian

Deriving the Kondo Hamiltonian involves separating the impurity spinon subspace (𝑛ˆ 𝑑↑ ≠
𝑛ˆ 𝑑↓) from the doublon and holon subspaces (𝑛ˆ 𝑑↑ = 𝑛ˆ 𝑑↓). The canonical (pun intended) way
24

Chapter 2. Preliminaries and Existing Results
of doing this is via a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation [15]. It involves applying a unitary
transformation on the original Hamiltonian such that the terms that scatter between the
two subspaces disappear, up to leading order. We are then left with a higher order intrasubspace scattering. It is often referred to as a one-shot renormalization group method,
because it kills all the off-diagonal terms in one iteration. The approach here follows that
in [14]. An alternate derivation via a projector operator method due to [12] is shown in
4.2.1.

𝑇 (𝐸), here, is the second order contribution of the 𝑇 −matrix due to scattering off the interaction 𝑉 . The |𝐻i act as the intermediate states during the second order scatterings.
This is a slight generalization from second order perturbation theory. In second order
perturbation, we only consider the scattering amplitude between the same states, but
here we consider the scattering between two potentially different states |𝑙i , |𝑙0i. The total amplitude is an average of these two amplitudes.

The sum is over all the intermediate states in going from |𝑖i to |𝑘i. For no flipping of the
conduction electron, there are four possible processes. The first process has the following T-matrix:

For excitations (𝑘) just above the Fermi surface, 𝛼 will encounter a zero in its denominator, because the integral in 𝛼 is outside the Fermi surface. On the other hand, the integral
in 𝛾 is inside the Fermi surface, so the denominator in 𝛾 will never become zero for 𝑘 just
outside the Fermi surface. Hence, 𝛼 = real part − 𝑖𝜋𝑁 ( 0), 𝛾 = real part. Accordingly, the
expressions for 𝑇𝑠 can be written as
𝑇𝑠 =

(2.4.71)

The maximum value of |𝑇𝑠 | will occur when the denominator is minimum, that is, when

For 𝑛𝑐 = 1 (half-filling), the mean field value is less than the one obtained from the spinspin scattering. This is because the mean-field analysis does not take these scatterings
into account. The large density of states at the Fermi level means that the spectral function has three peaks in general, two of which are revealed in the mean field analysis,
but a third one exists, which is of a width of the order of a very low temperature 𝑇𝐾 , and
hence is not noticed at higher temperatures.

Since 𝐽eff > 0, 𝛿1 < 0 and 𝛿0 > 0. The significance of this can be seen as follows. For scattering at the Fermi surface, the scattered wavefunction can be written as
𝜓 ∼ 𝜓in − 𝑒2𝑖𝛿𝑑 𝜓out
where 𝜓in =

𝑒𝑖𝑘𝐹 𝑟

(2.4.87)

This scattered wave is thus another radial wave but its phase is shifted by an amount
Δ𝑟 = 𝑘𝛿𝐹𝑑 . For a positive Δ𝑟 (and hence a positive 𝛿𝑑 ), the wave will be drawn inward. Hence,
the singlet channel having a positive 𝛿 will lead to formation of bound states. On the
other hand, the triplet channel has a negative phase shift, meaning it is repulsive.

2.4.4

Adiabatic route to the Kondo resonance

Assuming 𝑇 = 0, the interactions due to a single impurity are unlikely to break adiabaticity. Hence, we replace the effect of the 𝑈 on the impurity by adding a self energy Σ(𝜔) to
the bare energy 𝜖𝑑 . This self energy can be Taylor-expanded about 𝐸 = 0:
Σ(𝐸) = Σ( 0) + 𝐸

we can write



Σ(𝐸) = Σ( 0) + 1 − 𝑍 −1 𝐸

(2.4.90)

The interacting Green’s function for the impurity becomes
𝐺𝑑 (𝐸) =

𝐸 − 𝜖𝑑 − Σ − 𝑖Δ

(2.4.91)

where Δ is the result of the hybridisation. Substituting eq. 2.4.90 and gathering the terms
gives
𝑍
𝐺𝑑 (𝐸) =

𝐸 − 𝑍(𝜖𝑑 + Σ( 0)) − 𝑖𝑍Δ

(2.4.94)
(2.4.95)

What this means is that as we adiabatically vary the interaction 𝑈, the parameters 𝜖∗𝑑 and
Δ∗ also morph, keeping the form of the Greens’s function constant. In the non-interacting
limit (𝑈 = 0), we have
𝑍 = 1, Σ = 0 =⇒ 𝜖∗𝑑 = 𝜖𝑑 , Δ∗ = Δ
(2.4.96)
We then recover the atomic form of the Green’s function. 𝑍 varies from 0 to 1. 𝑍 = 1 is
the non-interacting limit, 𝑍 = 0 is the limit of 𝑈 = ∞. The phase shift due to scattering can
be calculated by looking at eq.2.3.27, and replacing the bare quantities with the renormalised versions:
