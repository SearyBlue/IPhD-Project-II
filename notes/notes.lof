\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.3}{\ignorespaces Left: RG flow for the two cases. The green line is the distance between the bare values of the two couplings, and hence also the magnitude of the denominator. The red arrow denotes the direction in which \(\epsilon _0\) will flow. Upward flow is increase. In both cases, the flow is such that the distance between the two quantities (and hence the magnitude of the denominator) increases. The RG fixed point occurs when the magnitude of the denominator goes to 0. This happens if the distance vanishes. Since the distance necessarily increases, we cannot get a fixed point in this way. Right: RG flow for the two cases with the new \(-\tilde \omega = \omega ^\prime - \frac {1}{2}\epsilon + \frac {1}{4}J\). Now we can see that in both cases, the flow is such that the distance (green dotted line) between the couplings decreases. A fixed point is reached when this distance vanishes.\relax }}{16}{figure.caption.8}%
