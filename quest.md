- Eq. 3.1 should have $\delta t \to 0^-$

- Eq. 3.56 should not have $\dagger$

- Eq. 3.15 should not have $\sum_\mu$

- The equation $d_\Lambda K = \frac{n K^2}{1-\frac{K^2}{16}}$ is valid only close to $\Lambda=0$. How can we integrate that for the whole range?

- How do we get the singlet ground state?

- Why does the singlet ground state energy appear in the energy of the disentangled electrions?

- Why drop terms of same spin in eq. 33?

- The derivative should produce a factor of 2 in eq. 34.

- In eq. 54, the $s^+$ and $s^-$ should probably be interchanged.

- How would you plot eq. 60?
